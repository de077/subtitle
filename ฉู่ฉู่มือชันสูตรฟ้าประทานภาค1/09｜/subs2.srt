Timing and subtitles brought to you by The Imperial Coroners @ Viki.com

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,670
Since the Coroner Qualification Exam,

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,130
I've done several autopsies for Commandery Prince An.

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,340
But I still failed the exam.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,500
Vice Minister Jing was right.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,400
Commandery Prince An seems to want me to stay.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,630
Although he said he is not the Handsome Judge,

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,480
he is really scrupulous and chary.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,700
None of the Shen Army's tricks escaped his eyes.

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,650
He strictly enforces the law and doesn't bow to power.

11
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,720
He is exactly the same as the Handsome Judge

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,380
in the Legend of the Nine Constables in Six Gates.

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,980
What's happening here?

14
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,060
It was you who came up with that title?

15
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,500
I was just joking.

16
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,309
There was no one else around when I said that.

17
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:59,530
If anyone knows about this, it can only be Prince Consort himself.

18
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,720
Could it be...

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,890
Could it be that Prince Consort is still alive

20
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,219
and he is in Qianzhou now?

21
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:14,140
I thought about whether Prince Consort is behind this girl.

22
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,510
But I got news from the Southwest

23
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,629
that the witch doctor who turned Prince Consort's cases into stories

24
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,940
was living in Pingle Town, Guanling County, Qianzhou.

25
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,229
Maybe it was because of some serious injuries,

26
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,980
he had trouble moving around for years.

27
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,000
Five years ago, he left his home.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,130
Since then, he went missing.

29
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,799
How would a person who had trouble moving around suddenly went missing?

30
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,500
He didn't have many friends in Pingle Town.

31
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,190
The only people who were close to him were the Chu family members.

32
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,229
If no one from the Chu family knows it, then no one else would know it.

33
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:14,819
[The Imperial Coroner]

34
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,740
[Episode 9]

35
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,860
There should be another reason

36
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,999
for Commandery Prince An to go to Qianzhou.

37
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:27,520
I'm afraid something went wrong in Qianzhou.

38
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,769
What Feng Jie, Liu Yue, Lu Chuansheng were dealing with

39
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,930
is more or less related to Qianzhou.

40
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,179
But what's the relation between the dancing girl and Qianzhou?

41
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,600
Although aconitine grows in many places,

42
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,539
the variety and toxicity vary in different places.

43
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,619
I've checked it. The aconitine used by the dancing girl to commit suicide

44
00:03:44,619 --> 00:03:47,009
is made in an ancient method in Qianzhou.

45
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:51,090
There are still some doubts about the case of Yan Ming.

46
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,580
I'll tell you about it after I verify it.

47
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,440
Now everything is related to Qianzhou, it cannot be a coincidence.

48
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,700
I'm afraid something concerning the country will happen in the Southwest.

49
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,870
Concerning the country?

50
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,380
What else did he say?

51
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,730
It seems to get more troublesome.

52
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,260
Do I have to go?

53
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,569
You have to go to the Southwest this time.

54
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:14,649
Besides what you need to do for Commandery Prince An,

55
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:17,180
I also have something for you to do.

56
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,870
Your Highness, are you all right?

57
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,030
I'm fine.

58
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,520
Your Highness.

59
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,660
Take these people back and find out who they are.

60
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,260
Yes!

61
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,570
I didn't expect that someone dares to assassinate you in Chang'an.

62
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,720
It isn't long since we met last time.

63
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,420
You got better at making enemies.

64
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,109
It's getting late.

65
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,549
You should go to Princess Xiping's Mansion.

66
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,729
If my mother asks about it...

67
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:55,260
Rest assured. I know how to make up a story. I'm leaving.

68
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,950
Hold on.

69
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,760
Are you not asking me why?

70
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,140
I've been doing what you told me to do since I was a child.

71
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,440
I don't care about the reason. You won't screw me up anyway.

72
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,829
Commandery Prince An likes pretty girls.

73
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,249
Then I'll show him a pretty girl.

74
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:23,550
This should be catering to his pleasure.

75
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,550
I can even fix a rotten face.

76
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,870
How hard can it be to fix my face?

77
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,940
[See the Wind and Listen to the Rain]

78
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,270
Miss Chu. Miss Chu.

79
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,979
General Wu, what's the matter?

80
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,720
I found your pass in that inn.

81
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,690
I guess you accidentally dropped it there.

82
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,739
You found it? Great.

83
00:07:01,739 --> 00:07:02,999
Thank you, General Wu.

84
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:04,489
I've brought the pass.

85
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,989
Miss Chu, open the door.

86
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:10,159
I'm not quite dressed yet.

87
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:13,449
Why don't you put it at the door and place a stone on it?

88
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,259
I'll come out and get it later.

89
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:17,420
Thank you, General Wu.

90
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:22,920
By the way, Commandery Prince An brought back what you left in Feng's manor last night.

91
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,840
I'll also leave it here for you.

92
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,739
Really? That's great.

93
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:28,670
Thank you, General Wu.

94
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,420
[Pass]

95
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,929
By the way, General Wu.

96
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:38,259
Did Commandery Prince An see the autopsy result?

97
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:39,309
Yes, he did.

98
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:40,699
Did he say anything?

99
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:44,970
His Highness said that you are a rare good coroner.

100
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,940
Really? Did he really say that?

101
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,670
I dare not make up what His Highness said.

102
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,360
That's great.

103
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,709
General Wu, has he come back?

104
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,140
He should be on his way back.

105
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,190
If you want to see Commandery Prince An,

106
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,020
I'll tell him for you when he comes back.

107
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,160
Thank you, General Wu.

108
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,220
Your Highness. We've carefully checked the eight corpses.

109
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,020
They are not from the Shen Army.

110
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,020
They are all death row inmates with marks on their faces.

111
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,220
We haven't found out which prison they escaped from.

112
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,309
It's Qin Luan indeed.

113
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,479
Qin Luan?

114
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,230
It was a eunuch from the Palace to offer condolence

115
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,480
who exposed the identity of Chu Chu to the Feng family

116
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,010
and encouraged them to tell the Emperor on me

117
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,669
so as to prevent me from investigating the cause of Feng Jie's death.

118
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,740
It was the people from Shence Army who set a fire at the mourning hall

119
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,950
and tried to burn up the corpse.

120
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,449
It was also the people from Shence Army who fooled the guards at the gate

121
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:57,330
and sent Xu Rugui out of Chang'an.

122
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,850
Except Qin Luan, there is no one else in Court

123
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,700
who can order both parties.

124
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:07,880
So the person who is behind Rugui Tarven is Qin Luan.

125
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,749
You knew that this eunuch holds grudges.

126
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,509
So you went with it and locked down

127
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,430
the Shen Army in the name of plague,

128
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,039
forcing Qin Luan to use other forces to tackle you and proved your speculation.

129
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,310
No.

130
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,369
Today I asked the Emperor to allow me to leave Chang'an tomorrow.

131
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:27,109
If he wants to kill me, he has to do it tonight.

132
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:31,909
In such a short time, he had no choice but to use his reserve force that is hard to find out in normal days.

133
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:33,839
Although he has been living in the palace,

134
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,659
there are only a few kinds of people he can buy off,

135
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:42,230
I still can't rest assured to leave without finding it out myself.

136
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,649
Based on the current situation,

137
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,399
The Rugui Tarven isn't a determinant of Qin Luan's power.

138
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,180
It's not the most important thing to find evidence and prove my speculation.

139
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,090
What matters is my mother's safety after I left.

140
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,720
Memorize the contents of these papers, then burn them.

141
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,099
After I leave, you must do what's written in the letter in person.

142
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:09,770
Remember, you must be really careful.

143
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,239
Any news you have can't be passed to others.
[Keep an eye on all the parties]

144
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:14,809
Send a letter directly to me.

145
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,899
Your Highness. Are you not taking me to the Southwest?

146
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,819
How can I not worry about it?

147
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,829
The Southwest is not Chang'an, Your Highness.

148
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:25,249
Not to mention you will take that suspicious Chu Chu with you.

149
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,550
Did she act suspiciously tonight?

150
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,030
No.

151
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:36,159
After Miss Chu finished dinner, she has been staying in Liutao Office and doesn't come out.

152
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,570
- But...
- No matter why she came here,

153
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,280
she has no interest in my life.

154
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,059
I've given her many chances.

155
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,420
If she wants to kill me,

156
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,249
she would have made a move a long time ago.

157
00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:49,059
Qin Luan failed to kill me tonight.

158
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:50,239
He will take action again.

159
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:54,009
Find some reliable people to protect my mother in secret.

160
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:59,409
Besides, after I leave Chang'an, the case files and items here will be coveted by someone.

161
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,909
These stuffs also need to be guarded well, as well as the contents in the papers.

162
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:04,479
If you don't stay in Chang'an,

163
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,519
I can't leave without worrying about them.

164
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,540
Your Highness, rest assured.

165
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,180
I'll take care of these things in Chang'an

166
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,479

00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,469
How can you try it on yourself?

179
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:00,170
I...

180
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,770
Wash your face first before we talk.

181
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,650
I mean,

182
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,429
they said that I am impatient.

183
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:24,500
After you come back, I'm not the most impatient person.

184
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,970
That Sun Mingde is hateful indeed.

185
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,839
You asked for a reward from the Emperor

186
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,739
to let him lead a horse for you.

187
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,329
Be careful that he will retaliate against you.

188
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,419
Even he wants to retaliate against me, will I fear a eunuch?

189
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,249
You are in Chang'an now.

190
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,569
We are under the Emperor's watch and you don't need to worry about it.

191
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,880
But if you leave Chang'an,

192
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,360
you must be careful about everything.

193
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,399
I just came back. I'm not going to leave.

194
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,030
I want you to leave.

195
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,290
Where do you want me to go, Auntie?

196
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,430
Qianzhou, the Southwest.

197
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,160
You are good-for-nothing.

198
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,550
Master, calm your anger.

199
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,899
Although we missed it and didn't kill Xiao Jinyu this time,

200
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:31,110
it was still a demoralizing blow for him.

201
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,950
How is that a demoralizing blow?

202
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,039
Wise like you, Master. Think about it.

203
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,739
Who dares to blatantly assassinate Xiao Jinyu in the imperial city?

204
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:43,739
No one but you.

205
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,759
How awe-inspiring you are.

206
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,130
That's a glorious defeat.

207
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,340
Get away!

208
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,780
Are you afraid that Xiao Jinyu won't find it out it was me?

209
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,630
Who did you learn from?

210
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,880
How can you be that stupid?

211
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,779
I learned from you...

212
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:10,180
No, no... I...

213
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,630
I thought myself.

214
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,500
Thanks to Xu Rugui.

215
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:33,080
Xu Rugui... Xu Rugui was thrown out of Chang'an by Xiao Jinyu.

216
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,640
I do better than he does.

217
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,529
Master, I'm stupid.

218
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:39,970
Please enlighten me.

219
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,460
Order Xu Rugui to head for Qianzhou immediately.

220
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,130
You want him to go to Qianzhou?

221
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,869
Qianzhou is his hometown.

222
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:55,339
He couldn't be more familiar with the people and the environment there.

223
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:58,380
We can't kill Xiao Jinyu in Chang'an.

224
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,900
But in the place with those wild bandits and thieves,

225
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:10,210
it's not up to him anymore.

226
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,509
Master, what about the female coroner?

227
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:16,199
Xiao Jinyu keeps a close eye on her.

228
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,440
It's hard to get her.

229
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,810
Ask Xu Rugui to take her together.

230
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,209
Don't tell him too much about it.

231
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:25,880
Just ask him to bring her alive to see me.

232
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,760
Yes.

233
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,079
Wu Jiang said you want to see me.

234
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:38,680
What's the matter?

235
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,330
I was going to show you my...

236
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,640
My skill to dress up the corpse

237
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,620
and see if you like it.

238
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,620
That's it?

239
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,530
I have something for you.

240
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,210
This is...

241
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,709
This is a mirror.

242
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,369
Look. One side of it is convex.

243
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:14,939
The other side is concave.

244
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:18,519
The convex side can provide a wider field of view.

245
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,419
The concave side can magnify small things.

246
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,580
I named it as the universe mirror.

247
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,310
Universe mirror...

248
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,840
Make big mirrors flat. Make small mirrors convex.

249
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,769
There is such a rule in the ancient method of making mirrors.

250
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,499
You are quite creative.

251
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,969
But why are you giving me this?

252
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:44,679
Now you have this universe mirror, you don't need to go into places without windows.

253
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:51,040
You can use it to look inside the room at the door.

254
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,939
Thanks.

255
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,410

00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,870
Yes.

00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,939
That's great. But you don't need to thank me.

258
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,520
I just put some effort.

259
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,949
I used your ladle to make this mirror.

260
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:09,010

00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:16,930
Make a mirror with this?

264
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,760
I bet you don't have such a mirror in the Three Judicial Offices.

265
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,030
This mirror is made with a ladle.

266
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:29,469
By the way, the stone used to polish the mirror was picked up in your backyard.

267

268
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,759
that I can't enter a place without a window.

269
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,400
I know.

270
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,160
I won't tell anyone about it.

271
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,470
Your Highness, if you don't believe me,

272
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,170

273
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,120

274

All right, rest assured.

275
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,480
Today you asked me about the exam result.

276
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,750
I didn't finish my words.

277
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,049
What?

278
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,550
In terms of the criteria I set for the selection,

279
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,990
no one passed the exam.

280
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:22,759
But right now, what I need the coroner to do is slightly different from before.

281
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:26,719
I can make some adjustments. You can try again.

282
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:29,069
Really? Can I take the exam again?

283
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:30,819
When and where?

284
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,089
I will leave for Qianzhou tomorrow to solve a case.

285
00:18:33,089 --> 00:18:34,309
Would you like to go with me?

287
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,949
I remember it.

288
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,370
The shopkeeper who escaped is from Qianzhou.

289
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,659
Your Highness, are you going to catch him?

290
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:46,960
You can say that.

291
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,619
You will go to Qianzhou with me, and I will test you along the way.

292
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:52,189
If you pass it, I'll keep you in Chang'an to work for me.

293
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:56,910
If you fail again, I can also verify your identity in Qianzhou.

294
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,899
If there is nothing wrong with your identity, you will be reviewed and rated.

00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:03,670
Going with me can also save you the expenses of going back home.

00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,220
Yes, I do.

299
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,610
How can I pass it?

300
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,580
It's up to me to decide.

301
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,419
You only need to do it as usual and wait for the result.

302
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:23,370

00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,269
I'm afraid it might jeopardize the stability of the Southwest of Great Tang.

359
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,180
The Southwest...

360
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:58,560
The last upheaval in the Southwest was in the Wenzong Dynasty.

361
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,069
The eunuchs were in great power and intervened in politics.

362
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,160
They controlled the Emperor and ruled the world.

363
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,029
The Prince Consort, Princess Xiping's husband, Xiao Heng

364
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,189
went to investigate the Military Commissioner of Jiannan, Chen Ying.

365
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:15,399
The head of the eunuchs, Qin Luan took the Shen Army to the Southwest

366
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,730
in the name of cracking down Chen Ying and supporting Xiao Heng.

367
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,980
But Xiao Heng never returned.

368
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,260
No one has ever seen him after that.

369
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:34,850
I don't know what happened exactly.

370
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:40,200
The eunuchs are no longer in power.

371
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,560
The Palace Domestic Service is under my watch.

372
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,040
I don't need to control them too tightly.

373
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,689
I've been makings all day long,

374
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:55,350
trying to balance the ministers and the eunuchs.

375
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:59,540
What I want is just to restore the prosperity

376
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:04,700
and make Great Tang flourishing again.

377
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,540
Your Majesty.

378
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:22,510
I've bought you what you wanted.

379
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,459
Your Majesty... mercy!

380
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,640
Mercy!

381
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,980
That's what you got?

382
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,760
Get up.

383
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,459
This is the sword of our famous founding member, Duke Li Jing.

384
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:08,930
It's normal that you are scared.

385
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:15,159
Your Majesty, I'm truly honored to be pointed by

386
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,389
the sword of a famous general which is held by the rightful emperor.

387
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:24,660
My life is not wasted even though to be cut into pieces.

388
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,030
Sun Mingde.

389
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,739
You didn't learn much from your master.

390
00:25:29,739 --> 00:25:33,159
But your tongue does get glibber.

391
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,660
Thank you for your praise.

392
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,019
All right.  I'll keep the sword.

393
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:40,400
Take the rest of these back.

394
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

395
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,460
Take it.

396
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,320
Master, I was scared to death.

397
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,710
Oh my goodness.

398
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,859
I mean, what did His Majesty want to do?

399
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:22,480
He just drew the sword out

400
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,550
and pointed it at the tip of my nose.

401
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:31,000
I thought I was going to die there.

402
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,459
You always teach me to guess the Emperor's intentions.

403
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,779
I keep guessing and racking my brains,

404
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:41,049
but I still can't figure it out.

405
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:45,880
The Emperor suddenly did that to me, what does he mean?

406
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,680
To tease you.

407
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:58,680
The Emperor shouldn't pick a fine sword for no reason.

408
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,530
But there is no war now.

409
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,140
What does he want to do?

410
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,800
I mean, Master...

411
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:23,160
What does the Emperor want to do?

412
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,380
[Princess Xiping's Manor]

413
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,300
Your Highness.

414
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,169
Miss Leng Yue came back.

415
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:41,050
Have you ever asked her about it?

416
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,880
What do you mean?

417
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,210
She and Commandery Prince An.

418
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,560
Well,

419
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,589
all Jinyu thinks about is the official affairs.

420
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,909
They left before I found a chance to ask them.

421
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:54,810
Anyway, Yue went with him.

422
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,759
They might be together when they come back.

423
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,640
It would save me the trouble to talk to them and annoy them.

424
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,429
But I heard that Commandery Prince An brought another girl

425
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,990
to the Southwest this time.

426
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,759
That's the new coroner he hired.

427
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:16,639
Are you worried that Jinyu, a first-rank prince, will marry a coroner?

428
00:28:16,639 --> 00:28:17,959
Of course not.

429
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:19,589
Commandery Prince An is noble.

430
00:28:19,589 --> 00:28:22,469
That coroner is lowly.

431
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,019
It's even inappropriate for her to be a maidservant

432
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:27,900
for Commandery Prince An.

433
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,799
Even if Commandery Prince An has any absurd idea,

434
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,090
the Emperor won't allow that.

435
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,209
I think you should ask the Emperor

436
00:28:37,209 --> 00:28:39,919
to grant marriage to Commandery Prince An and Miss Leng Yue.

437
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,529
They are perfectly matched.

438
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:44,199
The Emperor won't object to it.

439
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:49,329
With the imperial decree, this will be a godsent marriage.

440
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:53,160
You can rest assured earlie, if they settle down earlier.

441
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,940
They said that I'm impatient.

442
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:01,469
Right now, you are more impatient than I am.

443
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,659
It's about their happiness. How can I not worry about it?

444
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,929
You are born to worry about people.

445
00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:10,659
Your Jing Yi has been attractive to girls since he was young.

446
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:13,469
There are countless girls who fall for him.

447
00:29:13,469 --> 00:29:17,130
I think your manor must be thronged with girls.

448
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,219
What's the use of that?

449
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:23,549
That kid flirts with different girls every day.

450
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:26,659
Sometimes I think he is interested in every girl.

451
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:30,349
Sometimes I think he is interested in no girl.

452
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:33,829
When I ask him, he just jokes about it.

453
00:29:33,829 --> 00:29:35,550
He never takes it seriously.

454
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,680
If his reputation as a playboy spreads out,

455
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,420
I'm afraid no decent girl will marry him.

456
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:50,500
Speaking of him, he hasn't written a letter to us since he left.

457
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,459
Only I am worried about him.

458
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:57,460
I'm not worried about

459
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,380
his eating or sleeping.

460
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,279
He would never treat himself badly.

461
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,030
I'm just worried about Qianzhou.

462
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:08,279
I heard that there are wild bandits and the people are suffering.

463
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,379
Where did you hear that?

464
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:12,999
Even though Qianzhou is far away, it's still the territory of Tang.

465
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,729
Not to mention it's heavily garrisoned by the Military Commissioner,

466
00:30:15,729 --> 00:30:19,109
The bandits in the Southwest have been terror-stricken long ago.

467
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,309
They are far less wild than in the Sui Dynasty.

468
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:24,589
What's more, The Emperor has approved Jinli

469
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:28,110
to lead troops to protect their safety in Qianzhou.

470
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,019
Don't worry about it.

471
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:31,730
They will be fine.

472
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,830
Dear.

473
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,640
Dear, what's wrong?

474
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,729
Dear, the paper is really expensive.

475
00:30:45,729 --> 00:30:48,230
What's wrong, Dear?

476
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,830
Dear, what's wrong with you today?

477
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,570
What the hell is that?

478
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,869
It wastes my effort and comes to nothing. I'm not doing it anymore.

479
00:30:57,869 --> 00:31:00,880
Dear, calm you anger.

480
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,759
Dear, did you fail to persuade Princess Xiping

481
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,030
to ask the Emperor to grant a marriage?

482
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,880
She said she is not worried as his mother.

483
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,860
I'm the only one who is worried.

484
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:17,699
- Although I'm not like her, I'm still a Commandery Princess.
- Yes, that's right.

485
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,689
I suffered this all because of you!

486
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,090
I...

487
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,209
Jing Zhi. If you don't tell me

488
00:31:26,209 --> 00:31:29,949
why you want them to get married in such a hurry, it won't be over!

489
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,919
Dear, calm down.

490
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,900
Dear, have some water.

491
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:43,290
Dear, I did that for the sake of our son.

492
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,469
You are smart.

493
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,830
You know that our son falls for Leng Yue.

494
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,209
Think about it.

495
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:54,290
The five generations of the Jing family are all royal subjects.

496
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,569
Our roots are deep among the ministers.

497
00:31:56,569 --> 00:32:00,659
The Leng family has a big army and is occupying the Southwest.

498
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:02,519
If our children get married,

499
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,529
this is bound to affect the current situation.

500
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:09,209
For the two families, there are all harms but no benefits.

501
00:32:09,209 --> 00:32:13,250
We can rest assured earlier if we end his thought earlier.

502
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,910
I implore you to keep urging Leng Yue's marriage.

503
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:21,349
This is not just about the Jing family and the Leng family.

504
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,949
It's about everyone.

505
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,860
Everyone?

506
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,990
I just got news from the Southwest

507
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,649
The camp of the Military Commissioner in Qianzhou

508
00:32:37,649 --> 00:32:39,619
is slightly abnormal.

509
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,119
Leng Peishan is not as healthy as before.

510
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,729
He needs to burn mugwort every day.

511
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:45,509
It can be seen that something is wrong with his body.

512
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:47,869
But he refuses to report it to the court.

513
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:50,709
He is training soldiers in private and building his army.

514
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:52,840
It's suspicious indeed.

515
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,190
Well... What does Leng Peishan...

516
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,670
What does he want to do?

517
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:02,609
Leng Peishan hides it deliberately.

518
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:06,810
We can't be sure what his intention is right now.

519
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,880
But if Leng Peishan is gravely ill,

520
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,180
I'm afraid he will make a big move

521
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:18,320
to preserve his power in the Southwest.

522
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,860
Does Leng Yue know that?

523
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,740
It's hard to say.

524
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,600
What if...

525
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,909
No way.

526
00:33:26,909 --> 00:33:29,720
You have to tell our son about it.

527
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:34,259
He is with Commandery Prince An all the time,

528
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,259
and with Leng Yue following them.

529
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:41,040
This matter can't be said by any of us in our Jing family.

530
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,480
I will find out another way.

531
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:49,810
Dear, remember.

532
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:54,930
You can't say one word about this to anyone else.

533
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,300
[Qianzhou]

534
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:16,440
[Guanling Border, Qianzhou]

[Guanling Border, Qianzhou]

536
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,499
Your Highness, we've arrived at the Guanling border.

537
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:29,740
[Guanling Border, Qianzhou]

538
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,239
Your Highness. We will arrive in Pingle Town soon after we pass through the border.

539
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:02,959
We used to use the rope as a bridge.

540
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:05,809
A few years ago, the former prefectural government built a stone bridge.

541
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:08,320
It's much easier to get to our town now.

542
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:12,190
How can you use a rope as a bridge?

543
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,369
We would swing on a rope first
[Hillstone River]

544
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,109
and then climb for a while.
[Cross the river with a rope]

545
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:20,319
When there was no stone bridge, that was the only way for us.

546
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,410
It was really dangerous.

547
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:44,570
Master, I've sent the spices to Princess Xiping as you asked.

548
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,219
Is everything okay?

549
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,279
Banxia said Princess is doing well.

550
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,509
She thanked you for your concern.

551
00:35:49,509 --> 00:35:53,979
She also asked me that if you receive any news from Commandery Prince An.

552
00:35:53,979 --> 00:35:58,011
Well? Didn't Princess Xiping get news from Commandery Prince An?

553
00:35:58,011 --> 00:35:59,139
No.

554
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,479
But the Emperor has ordered General Xiao Jinli

555
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:04,109
to lead troops to protect Commandery Prince An in Qianzhou.

556
00:36:04,109 --> 00:36:06,910
I think they should be fine.

557
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,709
The Southwest is turbulent.

558
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,839
No news is the best news.

559
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:13,939
The time is up.

560
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,360
Master, it's time to enter the Palace.

561
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,739
I don't like this. I'm really scared.

562
00:37:05,739 --> 00:37:07,470
Don't talk.

563
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,199
The terrain is complex. We can't stay long.

564
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:18,010
Let's hurry up.

565
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,599
What's the rush, Commandery Prince An?

566
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,119
Long time no see since we met in Chang'an last time.

567
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:32,830
I heard that you even painted a portrait of me to look for me.

568
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,749
I'm truly honored.

569
00:37:34,749 --> 00:37:37,569
I've been waiting for you for a while.

570
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:40,190
I will send you to the underworld right now!
