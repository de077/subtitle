Zhao Jie killed Wu Chen after he learned that Wu Chen was exposed.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,300
He led his men and attacked the base.

[Qin Luan caught two maids who were dismissed from the Princess's Mansion]
[The Leng clan...]

00:00:17,499 --> 00:00:19,469
Fortunately, Commandery Prince An saw through his scheme.

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,550
He made a plan to lure the enemy in

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,940
and wiped out the rebels.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,469
[Wu has been eliminated. We can't meet as scheduled.]

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,940
No. It's not over.

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,200
This is the place where Wu Chen dealt with military affairs.

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,349
Commandery Prince An, go ahead and investigate as you want.

12
00:00:47,349 --> 00:00:48,810
Okay.

13
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,580
These are too many.

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,490
These are the accounts of procurement over the years.

15
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,370
They're all here.

16
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,349
Was Wu Chen responsible for all the accounts of procurement?

17
00:01:00,349 --> 00:01:02,330
He had three deputies.

18
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,779
But the final accounts need to be approved

19
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:07,610
and signed by Wu Chen.

20
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,310
Your Highness, this cabinet is strange.

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,829
Look.

22
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,620
It looks thick on the outside.

27
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,550
The content is the same as the book I just took.

28
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,110
Is this Wu Chen's handwriting?

29
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,759
Yes. Wu Chen once told me

30
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,500
that we can't only have a copy of the account book.

31
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,229
It's dangerous if it leaks out.

32
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,189
Therefore, he made a copy of it by himself.

33
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,010
This is the first time I've seen the backup.

34
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,009
Wu Chen was meticulous indeed.

35
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,660
He even made a backup.

36
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,300
The money of the government was not wasted.

38
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,640
Your Highness, what's wrong?

39
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,380
No. This is not a backup.

40
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,980
This is a different account book.

41
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,619
But these two account records are exactly the same.

42
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:25,889
Your Highness, did you find any code words?

43
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:27,340
It's not about code words.

44
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,109
General Leng, please make an order now

45
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,990
to search every barrack and warehouse on the base.

46
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,109
If I guess it right,

47
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,470
there should be a lot of supplies and weapons hidden here.

48
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:43,580
Commandery Prince An, the account records match the remaining money.

49
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,229
If Wu Chen bought twice the supplies every time,

50
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,720
how did he pay the other half of it?

51
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,799
With that money!

52
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,829
What money?

53
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,969
- Soldiers' pay.
- Soldiers' pay?

54
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,560
When I arrived in Qianzhou,

55
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,439
I borrowed some soldiers' pay from Jinli

56
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,359
and there were illegally minted coins among it.

57
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,689
Soldiers in the army rarely have a chance to spend money.

58
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:08,719
They can hardly tell the genuineness of the coins.

59
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,829
Not to mention these counterfeit coins are well-minted and can be mistakable for the real ones.

60
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:16,129
Besides, how would the soldiers

61
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:19,500
suspect the genuineness of the money from the government?

62
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,390
These people are really smart.

63
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,539
They got the money from the treasury in the name of soldiers' pay.

64
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,769
Then they replaced it with counterfeit money and paid the soldiers with it

65
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:28,109
so as to keep the genuine money.

66
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,270

General Leng, this is all the money I have.

72
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,159
It's my salary given by Commandery Prince An.

73
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,509
It's genuine.

74
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,010
It's not a lot,

75
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,700
but it can help you a little bit.

76
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,330
Please take it.

00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,109

78
00:05:44,109 --> 00:05:45,169
Don't worry.

I've been living on my own, but I never steal or rob.

80
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:50,190
The money is clean.

81
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,930
Take the money back.

82
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,770
Take it back.

It's my fault for being an old fool.

86
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,790
I let those rebels put me in this position.

87
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:12,680
I already feel embarrassed to let Commandery Prince An

just pretend that the money is from my father. Okay?

If my father were alive,

94
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,340
he wouldn't bear to watch you get in trouble.

95
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,650
He would find some way to raise money for you.

and scare them off,

102
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:05,189
the people in Guanling County wouldn't live such a peaceful life.

103
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:09,119
We never had a chance to thank you.

104
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:12,460
Take the money as I repay you on behalf of

105
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,240

I'll thank you on behalf of the soldiers.

108

Where did you get the money?

124
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:48,429
From the county offices nearby.

125
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:50,470
The far one will be here later.

126

The rebels have just been wiped out, and we found the supplies they hid.

127
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:57,379
The soldiers have started to feel edgy.

128
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:00,569
If we ask the soldiers to turn over their salary now,

129
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:02,149
I'm afraid there will be a big mess.

130
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:07,029
Yue, what he said is true.

131
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,569
General Leng, don't worry.

132
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,800
The best way right now is to raise enough genuine money

133
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,200
and use it to replace the counterfeit money of the soldiers.

134
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,279
Exchanging money for money won't neutralize the army.

135
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,709
I'm under the order to investigate the case of illegal minting of coins.

136
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,419
Leave the illegally minted coins to me.

137
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:22,639
I'll take care of them.

138
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,710
Then it can be solved justifiably.

139
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,110
Commandery Prince An, you...

140
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,710
General Leng, don't worry.

141
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,519
I didn't use my identity

142
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,760
to force them to take out the money.

143
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,460
Then...

144
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,560
Why were they willing to give us so much money?

145
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,569
When the emperor ordered me

146
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:46,710
to investigate the case of illegal minting of coins,

147
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,059
he granted me the right to act at my discretion

148
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:52,500
and ordered Qianzhou officials at all levels to fully cooperate with me.

149
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,419
Jing Yi and I took the imperial edict

150
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:56,900
and went to the surrounding county offices.

151
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,109
We ordered the county offices to take out 50,000 coins

152
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,500
from their treasuries and send the money to the army in the name of the investigation.

153
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:06,349
The Military Commissioner will send soldiers to assist in the investigation.

154
00:10:06,349 --> 00:10:08,039
They dare not defy the order.

155
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,719
The coins in their treasuries

156
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:12,939
were directly from the place where the money was made.

157
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:15,940
And they are afraid of being implicated.

158
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,409
They have verified the coins carefully before they sent them to us.

159
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:21,999
I also checked some of the coins.

160
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,199
They are genuine.

161
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,469
It's a temporary solution,

162
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,889
but it can help you out for now.

163
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:29,329
But, Commandery Prince An,

164
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:34,330
these troubles will all fall on you in this way.

165
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,059
If I can't raise enough money,

166
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:39,940
how are you going to deal with those county offices?

167
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,709
If they tell on you to His Majesty

168
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,789
and accuse you of playing favorites, then...

169
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,129
Don't worry, General Leng.

170
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:47,959
Since it's for screening,

171
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,230
it will take some time to verify the coins.

172
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,889
It makes sense even it takes us

173
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:57,370
two or three months to verify the coins one by one.

174
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,979
After I return to Chang'an and report it to His Majesty,

175
00:10:58,979 --> 00:11:00,539
the government will give you a grant

176
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:03,310
and you can return the money to them in batches.

177
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:08,560
Thanks a lot, Commandery Prince An.

178
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,909
General Leng, there is one more thing

179
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,730
that is more important than the coins.

180
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,490

181
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,960
I took the seal of Commandery Prince An and checked the recruitment of the Qianzhou Army.

182
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,259
I found out that the Qianzhou Army has been harassed by bandits.

183
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:28,739
They couldn't beat the bandits,

184
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:31,420
and some soldiers were taken captive.

185
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,560
Li Zhang never tried to solve it.

186
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,080
He just kept recruiting to replenish the army.

187
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,959
These were copied from the record book.

188
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,850
There is an important reason

189
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,759
why these wild bandits in Qianzhou can't be wiped out.

190
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,480
Prefect Li Zhang was protecting them.

191
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,769
First, Li Zhang recruited the rebels into the Qianzhou Army

192
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:52,950
and trained them above board.

193
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,709
After the training was almost over,

194
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,279
he would order those bandits

195
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,539
who took orders from him to rescue the rebels from the Qianzhou Army

196
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:02,750
and blend them into the bandits.

197
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,439
Then when your army went to suppress them,

198
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:06,700
they would surrender and join your army.

199
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,909
In this way,

200
00:12:07,909 --> 00:12:11,129
batches of rebels kept sneaking into

201
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:13,989
your army in a reasonable way

202
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:16,570
after they changed their identities three times.

203
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,399
Li Zhang is a talent indeed.

204
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,280
But he didn't use his cleverness in the right way.

205
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,070
Wait.

206
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:31,429
This number doesn't match the number of rebels we captured.

207
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,250
There are still many of them outside.

208
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,900
I guess they took the pass provided by Li Zhang

209
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,610
and headed for Chang'an.

210
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,129
But it's not easy to get into Chang'an.

211
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:46,600
They not only need a pass to enter Chang'an,

212
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,500
as out-of-town visitors, they will also be questioned many times by the guards at the gate.

213
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,930
If they go to the inn, they will be questioned again.

214
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,319
There are many of them.

215
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,520
How can they enter Chang'an?

216
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,780
The Imperial Examination.

217
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,479
More than a month later is the day of the Imperial Examination.

218
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:10,039
Right now, candidates from various places

219
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,510
and writers are flocking to Chang'an.

220
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,469
They want to take this opportunity to blend into them.

221
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,170
That's not good.

222
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,789
They are going to create a disturbance.

223
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:24,740
We must catch them immediately.

224
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,400
Blending into the candidates is like hiding wood in the forest.

225
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,980
How to catch them?

226
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:52,639
Your Majesty, I heard that Chang'an has been quite lively these days.

227
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,909
The Imperial Examination is coming.

228
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,700
All kinds of students have arrived in Chang'an one after another.

229
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,199
Scholars and writers gather in Chang'an.

230
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,819
The poetry and tea gatherings go on all day long.

231
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:07,669
Another collection of masterpieces will spread in the world.

232
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,390
When your posterity recites the poems,

233
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,730
they will be grateful for your keen intelligence and your grace.

234
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,620
How dare I talk about grace

235
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,880
in the land left by my ancestors?

236
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,610
I only hope that Tang can restore some of its prosperity.

237
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,390
Only in this way can I not fail

238
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,939
my ancestors and my people.

239
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:32,199
Your diligence and your care for the people have been seen by Heaven.

240
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,300
It's really exciting to think about all the talents of Tang

241
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,249
gathering in Chang'an.

242
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:42,370
That's true, Your Majesty.

243
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:47,870
But I have something inappropriate to say now.

244
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,420
Go ahead and say it.

245
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,640
Your Majesty, all kinds of candidates are flocking to Chang'an,

246
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:01,069
which means the number of people entering Chang'an from other places every day

247
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:02,900
is several times higher than usual.

248
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:09,630
I heard that the guards are understaffed

249
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:14,230
and it takes them too long to question every person,

250
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,050
leading to congestion and riots at the gate.

251
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,409
Did that happen?

252
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:21,989
Your Majesty, I dare not lie to you.

253
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,499
The examination is coming up.

254
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:26,479
There will be more candidates entering Chang'an.

255
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,409
The guards at the gate have to give up accuracy

256
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:32,229
and seek quickness because they are short-staffed.

257
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,129
If someone treacherous

258
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:37,989
takes advantage of it and sneaks into Chang'an,

259
00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:40,710
there might be some serious trouble.

260
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,950
You have a point.

261
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:48,039
Your Majesty, my Shence Army has been enjoying your grace for a long time.

262
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:50,780
We would like to share your worries.

263
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,200
Good.

264
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,220
The Shence Army has been guarding the Imperial Palace well.

265
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,970
During the Imperial Examination,

266
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:02,279
I'll let the Shence Army stop and search the passengers.

267
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,219
Select good men

268
00:16:04,219 --> 00:16:07,570
and make sure not to let any suspicious person in.

269
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

270
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,599
[Jinguang Gate]

271
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,450
All the soldiers, attention!

272
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,139
The Imperial Examination is coming up.

273
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:21,079
From now on, the Shence Army will be responsible for stopping and searching every passenger at each gate.

274
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,259
You shall carry out the order and make no mistake.

275
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:25,620
Yes!

276
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:33,470
Do you have feelings for that boy from the Jing clan?

277
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,080
Me?

278
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,930
How could I have feelings for him?

279
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,810
He is the last man I would have feelings for.

280
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,630
Yue'er, tell me the truth.

281
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,360
When did it start?

282
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,020
I...

283
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,490
I don't know.

284
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,500
It's been a while.

285
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:08,940
Does he know your heart?

286
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,140
I don't know.

287
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,479
But I know he has feelings for me.

288
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:20,170
He has feelings for you?

289
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,990
That's good. That's good.

290
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,670
General... General Leng...

291
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,560
Why are you here?

292
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,700
Come over and sit down.

293
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,320
- General Leng...
- Drink it first.

294
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,700
That's impolite.

295
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,930
Well? That's all you can drink?

296
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,470
Where did you get the gall to enter my base disguised as a wounded soldier?

297
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,589
General Leng, it was my idea to enter your base disguised as a wounded soldier.

298
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:36,549
I apologize for offending you.

299
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,740
Please don't blame others.

300
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:49,969
Aren't you afraid that I won't allow you to see Yue'er again?

301
00:18:49,969 --> 00:18:51,360
General Leng, I'm sorry.

302
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,430
I didn't do it on purpose.

303
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,099
I just thought you were brave and reliable.

304
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:01,900
Then, you act like this?

305
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,499
I don't feel like you are insulting me.

306
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,039
Isn't the Jing family best at reading signs?

307
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,999
Well, you can't even tell whether I'm praising you or insulting you now?

308
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,840
Hold on.

309
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,360
I still have something to tell you.

310
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,899
General Leng, please rest assured.

311
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,290
I will take good care of Leng Yue.

312
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,069
You mustn't think I don't know anything about the court

313
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,260
just because I'm in the Southwest.

314
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:45,749
It's your father who encouraged the emperor to grant marriage to Yue'er and Xiao Jinli.

315
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:49,240
There must be some misunderstanding.

316
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,100
Yes, there is some misunderstanding.

317
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,190
Sit down.

318
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,860
If I guess it right,

319
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,379
it must be that your father's informers found out that I'm seriously ill

320
00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:07,840
and I keep it from the court.

321
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,570
That combined with the illegal minting of coins in Qianzhou,

322
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,740
he thought I was going to die soon

323
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,719
and I planned to occupy the Southwestern territory

324
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,659
for the Leng clan before I died.

325
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:23,049
He is afraid that I will do harm to your family in Qianzhou.

326
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:27,880
So he came up with such a way to keep me at bay by letting them get married.

327
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,469
Your father is an old fox.

328
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,499
He is still full of cunning tricks,

329
00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:33,880
just like when he was young.

330
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,969
Now the truth has come to light. Please rest assured.

331
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:42,759
I'll write a letter to my father right away

332
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:45,600
and ask him to clarify this matter with the emperor.

333
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,660
You are too young.

334
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:52,599
You need to know the misunderstanding between your father and me is not new.

335
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,030
I heard that Commandery Prince An came here this time

336
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,310
to look for Prince Consort.

337
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,910
Have you found out the truth about

338
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,640
the miscarriage of justice of the Military Commissioner of Jiannan?

339
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,110
You knew what happened back then?

340
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,159
We have our own sources in the army.

341
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,610
What happened back then is little known.

342
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,699
But with all the pieces put together,

343
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,880
I knew a thing or two about it.

344
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,160
The Leng clan did something unethical

345
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,559
in order to protect ourselves.

346
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,930
After I took over the Leng clan,

347
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,950
I wanted to do something to make up for it.

348
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:37,999
I tried my best to save those so-called rebels

349
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,709
who escaped from your father.

350
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:45,210
But I had no evidence at all.

351
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:50,400
I knew the fact but I couldn't convince others.

352
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,899
Your father and I have been at odds,

353
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:56,800
but he is a man of honor and righteousness.

354
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,060
All the things that my father did

355
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,749
is because Prince Consort exonerated my father and saved his life.

356
00:22:02,749 --> 00:22:06,339
No one knows the pain of being wronged better than my father does.

357
00:22:06,339 --> 00:22:08,850
Now he knows the truth,

358
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,410
he won't stand by and do nothing.

359
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:16,130
You are a notorious boy,

360
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,850
but after my observation in the past few days,

361
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,529
I think you do have some balls.

362
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:24,530
I'll trust you this time.

363
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,809
After I get back to Chang'an,

364
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:31,280
I will have a good drink with your father

365
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,049
and say out loud all the swear words we have been saying

366
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:39,630
behind each other's back all these years.

367
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,949
General Leng, are you not going back to Chang'an

368
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:51,219
and find some good doctors to treat your illness first?

369
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,940
After so much chaos,

370
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,150
the army has been undermined.

371
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,659
Before the court appoints someone

372
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:07,060
to take over my job,

373
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,879
I'm not going anywhere.

374
00:23:08,879 --> 00:23:13,530
Your trip back to Chang'an will be dangerous.

375
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,259
No matter what I say,

376
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:20,160
Yue'er will share weal or woe with you.

377
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,120
I only have one granddaughter.

378
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,280
I'll entrust her to you.

379
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,530
You must take good care of her.

380
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:32,570
Otherwise, I'll wipe out the Jing family

381
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,160
even at the cost of my life!

382
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,480
General Leng, please rest assured!

383
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,449
I don't seek merit or fame.

384
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,400
Leng Yue is my only pursuit in life!

385
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,560
You entrust your granddaughter to me.

386
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,090
I will never fail your trust!

387
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,519
[Jinguang Gate]

388
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,120
Hold on.

389
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,580
General Wu.

390
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:25,100
Candidates are gathering in Chang'an these days. Thank you for your hard work.

391
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,509
It's my job.

392
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:28,410
I dare not take credit for it.

393
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,889
- General, are you leaving Chang'an?
- Yes.

394
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,210
Are you trying to hack me?

395
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,680
Wu Jiang.

396
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,540
You can read?

397
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,780
Where are you going so early in the morning?

398
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,630
It's official business.

399
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,670
Is Commandery Prince An back?

400
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,309
Are you asking me?

401
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:57,280
General Zhou, I need to ask you whether Commandery Prince An has returned.

402
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,080
Since His Majesty ordered Commandery Prince An to return to Chang'an,

403
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,919
you've been lingering around the gate day and night with your men.

404
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,460
You have almost worn out your eyes.

405
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:12,220
You are like a little wife waiting for her husband.

406
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,440
Am I right?

407
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,220
Commandery Prince An hasn't come back.

408
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,579
I am not as tired as you are.

409
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:25,189
Look. You've been really busy while Commandery Prince An is away.

410
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:27,950
You even lost weight.

411
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,030
Don't say that.

412
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:34,180
I'm only busy with my own work.

413
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,240
I'm not like you.

414
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,139
You need to handle your work

415
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,660
and keep an eye on what others are doing at the same time.

416
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,520
You should all learn from General Zhou.

417
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,600
He only gets one paycheck,

418
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,450
but he does two jobs!

419
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,500
Give it back to me.

420
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,639
What? I haven't checked it out yet.

421
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,129
I can't leave without it.

422
00:25:59,129 --> 00:26:02,509
I don't know if you are Wu Jiang if I don't check it out.

423
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,810
You want to play it in this way.

424
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,530
Your Highness.

425
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,860
I don't have time to make jokes with you.

426
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,880
I'm in a hurry to leave.

427
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,230
By the way, General Zhou.

428
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:27,170
You can keep following me as you want.

429
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,980
If you don't want to follow me, just wait for me right here.

430
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,970
I'll see you later.

431
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,550
Let's go.

432
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,080
[Notice]

433
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,810
Hey.

434
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,130
Yes, Sir.

435
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,870
What are you putting up?

436
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,510
It's the notice for the candidates.

437
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:56,289
There is a good harvest this year. His Majesty made an order to provide accommodation for all candidates.

438
00:26:56,289 --> 00:27:00,599
Candidates need to register and move in right after they enter Chang'an and follow the arrangement.

439
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:04,290
Do you know who suggested that to His Majesty?

440
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,589
Sir, His Majesty said that Senior Jing's idea is good.

441
00:27:07,589 --> 00:27:11,349
For the benefit of the candidates, His Majesty ordered us to do carry it out immediately.

442
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,480
Sir, do you have any other orders?

443
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,710
No orders, go away!

444
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,270
Let's go.

445
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,909
Well, now you have someone to back you up,

446
00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:21,600
you are different now.

447
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,289
You don't even bother

448
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,410
to have a serious fight with an underdog like me.

449
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,789
My good sister.

450
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:29,899
I need to ask you a favor.

451
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,900
You must help me out.

452
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,719
According to the message from Wu Jiang,

453
00:28:33,719 --> 00:28:35,609
Qin Luan has laid an ambush on the way to Chang'an

454
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:39,099
to prevent Commandery Prince An from returning to Chang'an.

455
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:42,400
Do you want my bros to escort you back?

456
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,599
No.

457
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:46,670
I need you to play a show with us.

458
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,719
Commandery Prince An has guessed what Qin Luan is up to.

459
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:55,049
Their fire and thunder bombs have been replaced by Wu Jiang.

460
00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:57,130
We'll just pretend that we know nothing

461
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,180
and get attacked as they expect.

462
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:03,570
So you want me to

463
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,770
disguise myself as Chu Chu?

464
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,910
Darn! It's not her!

465
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,430
Draw out those who lay in ambush and wipe them out to

466
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:17,460
not let the court know that Commandery Prince An is returning to Chang'an.

467
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,420
- Let's go!
- Go!

468
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,800
Beauty, are you all right?

469
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,299
These little bandits are not enough for me to flex my muscles.

470
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,129
- Right.
- Go!

471
00:29:50,129 --> 00:29:52,720
- Master, thanks.
- Hurry up!

472
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,999
You don't need to thank me.

473
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:56,380
I did it for Yue's sake.

474
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,369
Otherwise, the Zhenyuan Escort

475
00:29:58,369 --> 00:30:01,200
would never get into your mess.

476
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,920
There is news from Commandery Prince An.

477
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,450
It goes well. Stick to the plan.

478
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:17,141
Your Grace, Jing Yi sent it to me from Qianzhou.

479
00:30:17,141 --> 00:30:20,650
You know Jing Yi's handwriting.
[To Father]

480
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,740
[Father]

481
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,220
[They blended into the candidates and entered Chang'an...]

482
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,270
I really didn't expect

483
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:45,630
that the truth about my uncle is this.

484
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:48,919
It's also my fault for having a prejudice against General Leng.

485
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,069
I was impatient and careless.

486
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,890
I almost made a big mistake.

487
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,679
Thanks to these kids.

488
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,070
Otherwise, the consequences would be hard to imagine.

489
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:03,000
Sorry that I blamed you wrongly.

490
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,160
Please forgive me, Senior Jing.

491
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,040
Don't say anything like this, Your Grace.

492
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,330
I'm truly embarrassed now.

493
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,760
We both did it for the safety of Tang.

494
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,140
Yes.

495
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:24,559
Have you heard that the emperor has ordered

496
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,130
the kids to return to Chang'an?

497
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,830
Banxia already told me about it yesterday.

498
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:39,139
Don't worry, Minister Han.

499
00:31:39,139 --> 00:31:42,080
You are fine.

500
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,200
Thank you.

501
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,729
Dr. Zhang, you have a benevolent mind and heart indeed.

502
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,980
If I remember it correctly,

503
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,239
you have been working in the Imperial Medical Service

504
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,700
since the time of Emperor Wenzong.

505
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,979
Yes.

506
00:31:56,979 --> 00:32:00,360
When Princess Xiping was pregnant,

507
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,690
it was you who took care of her. Right?

508
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:06,909
To make sure Commandery Prince An and the kids can arrive in Chang'an safely,

509
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:11,560
I hope you can tell me the truth about one thing.

510
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,619
Please go ahead, Senior Jing.

511
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:17,170
Your Grace, is one of your sons

512
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:21,480
the child of Chen Ying, the former Military Commissioner of Jiannan?

513
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:25,910
Doctor Zhang, speaking of the twins,

514
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,820
I have something to ask you.

515
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,209
Commandery Prince An and General Xiao are twins,

516
00:32:31,209 --> 00:32:35,720
but why are they so different in terms of looks and temperament?

517
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,180
Doctor Zhang, don't take me wrong.

518
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,619
I'm just curious about it.

519
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,590
I'm just asking.

520
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:50,030
I guess you got the news

521
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,950
that Qin Luan found in secret the two maids

522
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:55,140
who worked for you before.

523
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,680
That's why you sent people to stop them at the gate.

524
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:04,280
Senior Jing, Xiao Heng was your best friend.

525
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,730
He saved your life when you were in distress.

526
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:11,390
How can you bear to slander his sons?

527
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:15,980
Your Grace, Heng was a friend worth dying for.

528
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,450
That's why I asked you that question.

529
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,020
In this case, I won't keep it from you.

530
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,259
Before Heng left Chang'an, he asked me

531
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:27,810
to take good care of you in Chang'an.

532
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:31,729
Over these years, I've been sending people to secretly guard your mansion.

533
00:33:31,729 --> 00:33:36,200
I've never been neglectful to this day.

534
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,930
Some time ago,

535
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:42,410
I heard that Qin Luan was secretly investigating your former maids.

536
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:46,889
I thought the emperor wanted to investigate it for General Xiao.

537
00:33:46,889 --> 00:33:50,980
Later, I learned that you were also looking for those maids.

538
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,090
Then I started to suspect it.

539
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,799
Your Grace, I think you know why

540
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:03,389
Heng went to the base of Military Commissioner in Jiannan at that time.

cherish this lifetime  ♫

♫  I’m still young, with my love not yet realized for you, but I'm
willing to be here for you till the end

553
00:35:57,609 --> 00:36:04,579
♫  You can rely on me in this lifetime  ♫

554
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:12,870
♫  Hope to spend this beautiful lifetime together  ♫
