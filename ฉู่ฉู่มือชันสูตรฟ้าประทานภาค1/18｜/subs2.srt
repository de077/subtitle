00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,160
Xu Rugui follows Qin Luan's orders.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,530
For all these years, he's been secretly investigating my father.

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,819
Xiao Heng escaped.

5
00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:19,789
Catch him.

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:24,689
There must be more secrets behind the Military Commissioner of Jiannan's usurp.

7
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:28,240
Qin Luan must have held something back from the imperial court.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,339
Maybe we can only find the answer

9
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:34,120
when we decipher the mysteries my father left behind.

10
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,299
Sir Witch Doctor drew these.

11
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:42,939
He likes to draw?

12
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:45,629
He didn't like it so much.

13
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,349
But right before he left, he somehow started to like it.

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,479
He drew nothing else.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,489
He just drew mountains and trees.

16
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:55,630
These are the views of Guanling County.

17
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,519
The mountain is Phoenix Mountain.

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,950
The river is Yong'an River.

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,700
The light.

20
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,529
Your Highness, what's on your mind?

21
00:01:14,529 --> 00:01:17,770
Does he always have such thick window paper?

22
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,029
No. It might have started when he began to like drawing.

23
00:01:22,029 --> 00:01:24,359
At that time, he bought many drawing papers.

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,049
Some were used to draw. Others were used as window paper.

25
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:31,159
He said it was windy at night. Air wouldn't come through if window paper was thick.

26
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,880
Chu Chu, pull down the curtains.

[Episode 18]

29
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,429
Your Highness, it's done.

30
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,220
See if the other side's wall is different.

31
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,539
- The wall?
- Yes.

32
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,519
Your Highness, come take a look.

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,720
There's a small bright spot on the wall.

34
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,429
I found it.

35
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,399
There's a small hole that has penetrated the wall.

36
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,629
It was covered by both sides' drawing paper.

37
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,069
When the room is dim,

38
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,799
if we light candles in the other side's cabinet,

39
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,909
the candle light will

40
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,109
cast this bright spot on this side's drawing paper.

41
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,820
Did Sir Witch Doctor do this?

42
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,269
In the previous Sui Dynasty, construction was often performed.

43
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,559
Once, 300,000 taels of construction fee got lost abruptly during transport.
[Rapid constructions]

44
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:21,430
They found no trace of it
[Transporting construction fund]

45
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,859
until the judge found out how they hid the money.

46
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:27,279
Then, the world knew the truth.
[Judge]

47
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:28,659
The ministers involved in the case
[Notice]

48
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,089
used the principle of Borrowed Light.
[Truth came to light]

49
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,759
They used the tavern wall and the paintings to

50
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,769
design a map to mark the location where they hid the money.
[Borrowed light]

51
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:38,879
So they can split booty afterward.

52
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,020
[Treasure]

53
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,629
This case was adapted into novels

54
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:45,659
and was spread widely across the nation.

55
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,870
I think my father learned this trick from it.

56
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,289
Your Highness, something went wrong with the Chu family.

57
00:03:58,289 --> 00:03:59,790
Let's go.

58
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,210
Your Highness.

59
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,779
It's my fault. Please punish me.

60
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:12,109
Grandfather, are you all right?

61
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,629
I'm fine. But your brother is missing.

62
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,859
Grandfather, don't worry.

63
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:17,509
His Highness is here. My brother will be fine.

64
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,229
What happened? Who did this?

65
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,009
- Where is Xu Rugui?
- Your Highness, we don't know what happened earlier.

66
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:24,709
Xu Rugui suddenly broke free from the ropes, attacked us, and tried to run away.

67
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:28,109
When we were fighting, these people who dressed like bandits broke in.

68
00:04:28,109 --> 00:04:30,509
Xu Rugui was obviously their target. We were outnumbered.

69
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:31,999
Xu Rugui escaped amid the chaos.

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,549
The bandits went to pursue Xu Rugui. Zhang Yun went after them.

71
00:04:34,549 --> 00:04:37,820
I stayed here to ensure the Chu family's safety.

72
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,759
[Rope File]
[Cut]

73
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,739
- Where is Chu He?
- We didn't notice that.

74
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:52,719
We also didn't hear another fight.

75
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:55,729
We only found Chu He missing, when the Chu family's seniors asked us.

76
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,869
Don't worry, Your Highness. I've already asked people from the County Office to pursue them.

77
00:04:58,869 --> 00:05:01,169
- How many bandits ran away?
- Two.

78
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,899
Chu He spent time alone with Xu Rugui?

79
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,059
Yes, Your Highness.

80
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,479
Chu He brought food to Xu Rugui.

81
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:26,890
He spent around 30 minutes alone with Xu Rugui.

82
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,840
Chu He?

83
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,819
This is a tool for carpenter work.

84
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,249
Xu Rugui must have used this to cut the rope.

85
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,620
Why would Chu He help Xu Rugui escape?

86
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,879
Why did you allow Chu He and Xu Rugui to spend time alone?  You—

87
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:03,939
It's my fault. Your Highness, please punish us.

88
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,749
Your Highness.

89
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:10,349
Chu Chu, inspect the bodies first.

90
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:11,850
Okay.

91
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,439
The dead is well built.

92
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,599
There are thick calluses on his palms which were formed because of training.

93
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,330
The wound on his chest is fatal.

94
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,860
This man has the same calluses.

95
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,109
These people were soldiers.

96
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,910
Soldiers?

97
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,109
I can tell from the calluses on their palms.

98
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,619
These were formed from years of training as soldiers.

99
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:58,579
The training for soldiers is different from the training of martial art learners.

100
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:01,509
So the calluses are different, too.

101
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,789
Soldiers?

102
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,100
Are they Shence soldiers sent by Qin Luan to silence Xu Rugui?
(Shence Army was a Tang dynasty army unit, based in Chang'an, forming the core of the imperial guards responsible for protecting the emperor.)

103
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,540
The group of people who broke in first had Shence Army's fighting skills.

104
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,010
But those who broke in later are weird.

105
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,670
Xu Rugui broke free from the rope and fought with us.

106
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,609
At that moment, the first group broke in.

107
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:33,030
They were determined to kill Xu Rugui.

108
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,999
Then the next group broke in.

109
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,349
They didn't try to kill Xu Rugui.

110
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,530
On the contrary, they tried to protect him.

111
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,979
These two groups of people also engaged in fights themselves.

112
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,920
Those who tried to kill Xu Rugui

113
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,029
were from the Shence Army.

114
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,439
The other group were here to catch him.

115
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,509
Catch him?

116
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,139
That's weird.

117
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:05,109
No, it isn't. This is the fight between the snipe and the mussel.

118
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,550
The snipe and the mussel?

119
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,549
Qin Luan's Rugui House is the buyer.

120
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,789
Those who committed the crimes at Qianzhou are the seller.

121
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,439
This originally should be a trade that benefited both parties.

122
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,199
Now, Rugui House's case has been solved.

123
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,199
They're now the snipe and the mussel.

124
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,349
Now, the mussel knows everything about Rugui House.

125
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:25,669
They want to control Xu Rugui and use him as leverage

126
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,729
to become the buyer.

127
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:30,639
What are you talking about? I'm so confused.

128
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,319
How can you be confused? Let me explain it.

129
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,089
His Highness means that there are two parties of bad people.

130
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,029
- Two parties?
- Yes.

131
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:40,859
One side wanted to kill people.

132
00:08:40,859 --> 00:08:43,749
But they were unwilling to do it themselves. So they paid for hitmen.

133
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:47,179
The other group of people commits murders for money.

134
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,719
Think about it. Killing for money is supposed to be a secret.

135
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,449
So, the buyer just knows whether the target has been killed or not.

136
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:57,219
They won't know who does it.

137
00:08:57,219 --> 00:08:59,859
But now His Highness has shut down Rugui House.

138
00:08:59,859 --> 00:09:02,859
The buyers now know Xu Rugui is the one who collected the money.

139
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:08,199
So, the buyer discovered that Qin Luan is behind Xu Rugui

140
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,510
and tried to use Xu Rugui to threaten Qin Luan.

141
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,700
I get it. Then this is a double-cross.

142
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,199
That's right.

143
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,909
Clear the floor first.

144
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:20,359
Jinli, your men are more familiar with this neighborhood.

145
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:23,179
Please send more men to search for Chu He.

146
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,539
Oh. Take Chu He's dog with you.

147
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,619
It's familiar with Chu He's scent. It can somehow help.

148
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:32,029
Xu Rugui was badly wounded after this fight.

149
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,569
He can't go far.

150
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,609
Pay attention to the hiding spots nearby.

151
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,110
Okay.

152
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,459
Jing Yi. Leng Yue. Go to the County Office and bring more people.

153
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:46,089
Clear this area. Just tell them the bandits attacked. Nothing more.

154
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,630
- Yes.
- Okay.

155
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,590
Chu Chu, come with me.

156
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,779
What?

157
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,149
Didn't you hear it? There was a breathing sound.

158
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:28,410
Someone has been following us.

159
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,209
No. You must have made a mistake.

160
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:32,639
It's our own breathing sound.

161
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,250
Xu Rugui is just ahead of us. Hurry.

162
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,549
Xu Rugui is very cunning.

163
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,670
Beware of his traps.

164
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,950
So annoying.

165
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,669
The forest is rainy. The road is muddy.

166
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,379
The passersby will leave foot tracks. Observe the road.

167
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:19,880
Yes!

168
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,600
Your Highness, actually I...

169
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,559
You already know, don't you?

170
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,299
What should I know?

171
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:42,879
About my father and mother.

172
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,709
You've interrogated Xu Rugui.

173
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,000
So, you must know everything.

174
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,079
He did say something about your father and mother.

175
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,959
But those haven't been verified.

176
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,959
After I verify it, I'll tell you everything honestly.

177
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,650
Did he tell you that my father is

178
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,220
the rebel, Yun Yi?

179
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,500
Yes.

180
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,029
But it's just his one-sided accusations.

181
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,709
We can't come to a conclusion for now.

182
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,309
Can you tell me the things you have verified about my father and mother?

183
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:14,609
Xu Rugui is lying, right?

184
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,030
Bad people all lie, right?

185
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:28,389
I went to the Xu Mansion to look for you because Xu Rugui left this hairpin behind.

186
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,649
You're saying that Xu Rugui intentionally left this at the scene for you?

187
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:36,860
Why would he do that?

188
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,419
At first, I didn't understand either.

189
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,379
So I rushed back to the County Office and looked through your mother's bequest.

190
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:45,039
And I found out that your father might be an officer who worked for the Military Commissioner of Jiannan.

191
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:47,270
Then I understood his intention.

192
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,320
What is it?

193
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,860
He led me on the investigation of your father,

194
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,040
hoping it can destroy our trust in each other

195
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,179
and force you to leave and become a part of his team.

196
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,859
So, what Xu Rugui said is real?

197
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,219
I told you.

198
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,319
It hasn't been verified. So we can't reach a conclusion.

199
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:11,000
But you've already deduced that he might be an officer for the Military Commissioner of Jiannan.

200
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,739
Then... is he the rebel, Yun Yi, that Xu Rugui talked about?

201
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,859
That's exactly why Xu Rugui is cunning.

202
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,029
He wanted me to discover this when I was looking for you.

203
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:26,329
I would easily forget that my original intention was to search for your whereabouts.

204
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:29,609
Instead, I would go on an investigation to see whether your father was the rebel.

205
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:32,519
In that case, he would have more time to get out of the pursuit.

206
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,659
But, Your Highness—

207
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:38,129
Chu Chu, finding your whereabouts is different from the investigation of your father's identity.

208
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:43,599
The only connection is the fact that Xu Rugui wants to use it to distract me.

209
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,049
What about now?

210
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,690
If my father is really the rebel, Yun Yi, will I get you in trouble?

211
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,129
Jinli.

212
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,299
General Xiao, why are you here?

213
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,639
This road leads to the mountain.

214
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,049
Are you going to the mountain area to look for my brother?

215
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,050
What happened?

216
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,659
Chu He might have fallen into the river by accident.

217
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,859
A clear mark at the upper stream's riverside indicated that someone fell into the water.

218
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,979
The mark is roughly the same size as Chu He's footprint.

219
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,469
When we reached the spot, we also heard a scream from Chu He.

220
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,339
And this dog's reaction also confirmed that Chu He was once there.

221
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,149
But after that, we found no trace of him.

222
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:31,139
My brother is a good swimmer. He can get back to shore soon.

223
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,099
Chu Chu, don't worry.

224
00:14:33,099 --> 00:14:35,399
Chu He might have swum to the opposite riverside.

225
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,379
I was talking to Chu Chu back then. We didn't pay attention to the river.

226
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:40,519
He might have swum to the other side.

227
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,739
Jinli, please take some men and search the opposite riverside.

228
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,469
This row. Go search the other side.

229
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,870
Yes.

230
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,230
Jinyu, come over here.

231
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:04,999
What?

232
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,549
I haven't had time to talk about this with you.

233
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,229
Chu He made such a scene.

234
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,569
I think it's about that case.

235
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,459
We don't have time to waste. Just say it.

236
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,239
I accidentally heard Chu He and his father's conversation in the kitchen.

237
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:23,049
If I marry Chu Chu, she will be my wife then.

238
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,469
Whether she accepts the family or not, she is part of the Chu family.

239
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,219
Even if you want to, you have to get the approval of Chu Chu.

240
00:15:30,219 --> 00:15:31,859
Ridiculous! He is...

241
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:33,419
What?

242
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:35,839
They're not related by blood.

243
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,379
And over the past days, by my observation, I think he truly has feelings for Chu Chu.

244
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:42,710
And today's incident.

245
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,169
Today's incident?

246
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,199
What are your concerns?

247
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,149
You found a filing blade in the coffin workshop, right?

248
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,439
The guards also said that Chu He spent some time alone with Xu Rugui.

249
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,899
Maybe, Chu He found out that Xu Rugui is Miss Chu's uncle.

250
00:15:56,899 --> 00:15:59,339
He's worried that Xu Rugui may take her away,

251
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:02,929
or get Miss Chu in trouble because of his crimes.

252
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:05,519
So, he let Xu Rugui escape.

253
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:10,049
He thought if Xu Rugui escaped or got killed, Miss Chu could stay.

254
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:14,280
So you suspect that Xu Rugui escaped to avoid punishment?

255
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,910
Chu He's tracks follow the same route as Xu Rugui's.

256
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:29,589
Don't tell anyone this, for now, especially Chu Chu.

257
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,959
But do you really think Miss Chu is completely

258
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,050
unaware of Chu He's feelings?

259
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,259
Miss Chu!

260
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,549
Jinyu!

261
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,150
Your Highness.

262
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:56,250
- General.
- General.

263
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,430
His Highness. Hurry. Where is His Highness?

264
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:02,070
I have something I want to give you.

265
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,329
With this Qiankun Mirror, if you're at a place without windows,

266
00:18:07,329 --> 00:18:08,999
you don't have to go inside.

267
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,830
You can use this to see the views inside at the door.

268
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,300
Do you like it?

269
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,410
You're Handsome Judge?

270
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,679
You don't have to be so distant as well.

271
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,939
Don't call me Miss Chu. Just call me Chu Chu.

272
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,109
What's the embroidery on your handkerchief? It's a bone.

273
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:39,639
The fifth rib bone on the left chest.

274
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,799
When you put your hand on the bone's position,

275
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,760
you can feel your heart pounding.

276
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,530
Hurry. Come on.

277
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,949
Jinyu, wake up.

278
00:19:01,949 --> 00:19:03,579
Jinyu, are you all right?

279
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:06,700
Jinyu, wake up. Jinyu.

280
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,580
- Chu Chu.
-  Wake up.

281
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,700
- Where's Chu Chu?
- Chu Chu.

282
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,490
- Where's Chu Chu?
- I...

283
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,480
- Hurry. Here's one more.
- I don't know.

284
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,479
Jinyu.

285
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,980
Chu Chu.

286
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,119
Are you crazy? Why did you dive in?

287
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:54,279
I... I saw my brother's clothes in the water.

288
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,799
I knew that he was trapped in the river.

289
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,229
He took off his clothes to ask for help.

290
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,089
Those who grow up next to rivers all know this.

291
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:02,839
But you shouldn't jump in!

292
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,640
But, I...

293
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,679
He woke up.

294
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,480
He's alive.

295
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,660
[Guanling Yamen]

296
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,470
Brother.

297
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,140
Miss Leng, how's my brother?

298
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,609
He's fine. He was just startled because he almost drowned.

299
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:45,139
I'll write him a prescription. Later, you can boil it and make him drink.

300
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,130
Chu Chu.

301
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,330
Deputy Magistrate Tan.

302
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,120
Vice Minister Jing.

303
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,329
- Why are you here?
- I heard that things went wrong at the County Office.

304
00:21:12,329 --> 00:21:16,130
So I came here in a hurry to see if my service was needed.

305
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,510
Why are you in the wild in the middle of the night?

306
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,160
[Foot Length: 10 inches | Foot Width: 4 inches]

307
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:35,220
Foot length is 10 inches. Foot width is 4 inches

308
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,620
Stride is 1.9 inches. Slightly crooked.

309
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,370
He's the man from that night.

310
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,249
Please do us the favor, Deputy Magistrate Tan.

311
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,050
Go get some medicine.

312
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,650
No need.

313
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,769
I know where the pharmacy is. I can buy it myself.

314
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:03,229
Deputy Magistrate Tan, please bring some clean clothes for Chu Chu.

315
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,730
Yes.

316
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,970
I'll do it right now.

317
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,959
Jinyu, open the door.

318
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,879
I'm fine.

319
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,579
Open the door!

320
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:25,729
I'm changing my clothes.

321
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,510
Open it! Or I'll break in.

322
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,430
I'll break in!

323
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,489
Jinli, I'm fine.

324
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,659
How can you be fine?

325
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,719
You drowned once when you were a kid. You were so sick that you almost died.

326
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:43,939
I'm not a kid anymore.

327
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,079
That won't change anything. Let Leng Yue check on you later.

328
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:48,969
The water was freezing. How can you bear it?

329
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:51,849
If you're sick, what should I do in a desolate place like this?

330
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,939
Who taught you how to swim?

331
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,139
You're not a good swimmer. How dare you dive in the flooding water?

332
00:22:56,139 --> 00:22:58,349
No one taught me. I learned it myself.

333
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,109
What?

334
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:01,449
You said Chu Chu was mad.

335
00:23:01,449 --> 00:23:03,359
I think you are.

336
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,639
There were many people on the shore.

337
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,779
Who isn't healthier than you, or a better swimmer?

338
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,720
What were you thinking?

339
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,619
She dived in the water without any notice.

340
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,640
What could I think of?

341
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,299
She lives next to Yong'an River.

342
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,579
The kids in the town grow up playing in the river.

343
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,419
You don't know how to swim, and you're unfamiliar with the river.

344
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,920
She might be the one who saves you.

345
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,879
If I say I don't even know why I jumped,

346
00:23:25,879 --> 00:23:28,769
that I was already in the river when I realized it,

347
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,690
Jinli, would you believe it?

348
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,209
You!

349
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,800
I think you're under a spell.

350
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,529
On the contrary, I was indeed under a spell before.

351
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:43,699
I thought I could see through everything.

352
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,919
But, in the end, I didn't even understand myself.

353
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,609
What?

354
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,110
Nothing.

355
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,919
Listen to me!  No matter what happens,

356
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,660
you must stay away from water. Do you hear me?

357
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,200
If you dare to jump into the water again, I'll immediately escort you back to Chang'an.

358
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,250
I got it.

359
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:03,119
Have the men you sent to search for Xu Rugui returned yet?

360
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,729
No.

361
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:07,289
I left a team there. They'll keep on searching.

362
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:10,220
They'll report to me once they find anything.

363
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,329
Xu Rugui betrayed his master to save his own life.

364
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,299
They now want him dead.

365
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,489
He dares not to go back to Chang'an.

366
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,409
If you're right, Guanling County is his hometown.

367
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,129
He knows every bit of this place.

368
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,149
It's possible that he's hiding in the nearby mountains.

369
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:27,159
The Southwest Mountain has a complex environment.

370
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:32,859
It might take a while to capture a person who's familiar with it.

371
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,929
How about I ask Magistrate Zheng to assemble the villagers and search the mountain together?

372
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:36,979
No.

373
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,630
If you startle Xu Rugui, innocent people might get hurt.

374
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,710
Let me think about it.

375
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:47,140
[Guanling Yamen]

00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:56,649
This is the map of Guanling County.

378
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:59,259
Are you responsible for guarding this area?

379
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,529
Yes.

380
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,459
Guanling County has a complicated terrain.

381
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,809
The mountains and waters are perplexingly intertwined.

382
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,579
When I first came to the office,
[County Office Pingle Town Phoenix Mountain]

383
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,549
there wasn't any road connecting the county to the outside world.

384
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:15,179
Villagers can only use the strop.
[Rocky mountain River Strop]

385
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:16,909
Around five years ago,
[Villager]

386
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,479
Prefecture Yamen allocated special funds to build official roads.

387
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,579
Then, people were able to communicate more with the outside world.
[Allocated fund to build road]

388
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:24,829
[More communication with the world]

389
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:30,990
But since then, there have been more bandits.

390
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,679
Commandery Prince An, I have reported many times to the prefecture Yamen,

391
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,629
asking them to send us more men.

392
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,439
But there hasn't been any follow-up.

393
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,439
About this, I...

394
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,940
You're feeling wrong?

395
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,580
No, I dare not.

396
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:52,259
Since this case happened in your administration,

397
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:56,540
no matter what the reasons are, you're the one responsible for it.

398
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,519
If I hear another excuse from you,

399
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:01,559
I'll report you to the Imperial Court

400
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,760
to decide whether you're wronged or not.

401
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,159
Commandery Prince An, don't be mad.

402
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,919
I failed my obligations.

403
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,990
I must be punished.

404
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,149
Stand up.

405
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,339
Thank you, Your Highness.

406
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:22,879
Point out every possible way that leads in or out of Guanling County,

407
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,100
whether it's a road in the mountain or one on the water.

408
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,410
Yes.

409
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,810
Commandery Prince An, this is where the Country Office is at.

410
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,100
There are six rivers leading to the county.

411
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,679
Failed to catch him. Still pursing.

412
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,869
A bunch of fools.

413
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,880
I still need to do it myself.

[Jing Mansion]

00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,909
Minister Xue has arrived?

417
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,929
No.

418
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:46,199
Someone from the Xue Mansion said that Minister Xue went to the palace

419
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,190
this morning and will return later to visit you, Master.

420
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,599
The palace?

421
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:56,540
[The Book of Xiangjing]

422
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,709
Your Majesty, one of the records made by Minister Feng

423
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,210
during his inspection of the Southwest was missing.

424
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,590
Missing?

425
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,769
Which scroll? Where?

426
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,990
It was lost before it was brought to the capital.

427
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,519
I've read the inspection records.

428
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:23,809
The time and routes recorded in the three scrolls are consistent.

429
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,959
There's nothing missing from them.

430
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,259
Your Majesty.

431
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:31,799
I only knew this when Minister Feng's accompanying officers

432
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:34,019
handed over the work to me.

433
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,289
Besides the three scrolls of records already submitted to Your Majesty,

434
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:41,519
Minister Feng compiled the information of other affairs separately in another scroll.

435
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,280
What affairs?

436
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,699
I asked his accompanying officers.

437
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,499
They said they don't know.

438
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,149
I did some investigation at the Feng Mansion.

439
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:55,030
No one at the Feng Mansion has ever seen it.

440
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:59,599
Minister Feng died the night before his return to the capital.

441
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,919
Did this scroll get lost on its trip back to the capital, or...?

442
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,220
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

443
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,099
Your Majesty, don't be mad.

444
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,059
This is a serious matter. I dare not make a big scene.

445
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,779
I'm afraid I might be mistaken. It might have been left somewhere I missed.

446
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:18,219
Over these days, because I searched everywhere and found nothing,

447
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,160
I dare to report to Your Majesty.

448
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,590
It would be fine if it was just lost,

449
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:29,490
but if someone deliberately prevented me from seeing the records,

450
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:34,330
it means that Feng Jie has really found something on his trip.

451
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,789
[Qianzhou]

452
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:43,559
Your Majesty, the ministers all know that I was an academician.

453
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,919
I'm not an expert in military and political affairs.

454
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,330
Your Majesty, please allow me to

455
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:52,680
investigate Qianzhou's prefecture-level military and political affairs.

456
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,109
I'll allow you to investigate Qianzhou's prefecture-level military and political affairs.

457
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,349
military and political affairs.

458
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,799
Li Zhang, the Prefect of Qianzhou, has been in office for years.

459
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,049
He's been good at managing military and political affairs.

460
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:04,219
You can take the opportunity to learn from him.

461
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,220
Thank you, Your Majesty.

462
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:13,229
Who else knows about Feng Jie's missing investigation record?

463
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,249
Only the few accompanying officers know this.

464
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:19,029
I didn't even tell the people at the Feng Mansion.

465
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:23,160
Don't tell anyone about this before you return to the capital.

466
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,730
Yes.

467
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:30,100
Eunuch Qin, you asked me to keep an eye on Shen Yu, the new Capital Liaison Representative of Qianzhou.

468
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:31,959
It's been a while.

469
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,659
Since Shen Yu came to the capital,

470
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:36,629
he's been giving gifts to every minister.

471
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,879
Even I have received from him the specialties of the Southwest.

472
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,800
It's normal to give presents and make friends for a new minister.

473
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,499
Is there anything odd with the gifts?

474
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,949
No. Nothing.

475
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,929
Just some snacks or daily necessities. Nothing valuable.

476
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:58,339
They're roughly the same things the other Qianzhou officers gave to capital ministers.

477
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,109
Roughly the same?

478
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,899
What's the difference then?

479
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:07,150
Are they entirely the same or a bit different?

480
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:11,690
This... I... I'm still looking into it.

481
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:16,689
Oh! In the past, the ministers were always talking about the previous officers of Duke Chang.

482
00:31:16,689 --> 00:31:21,559
I did some digging to see if they have any connections with Shen Yu.

483
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:26,160
I think the story about Duke Chang is just a rumor.

484
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,260
It's not that simple.

485
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,829
Listen up!

486
00:31:31,829 --> 00:31:34,699
Keep an eye on what's going on outside the palace.

487
00:31:34,699 --> 00:31:36,879
Report to me immediately when you get any news.

488
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,569
Yes.

489
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,939
And there's more.

490
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:45,199
Not long ago, Wu Jiang went to the Jing Mansion and gave Senior Jing a copper coin. It's from Qian Printing.

491
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:46,899
A copper coin?

492
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,009
Yes. Nothing more.

493
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:52,939
I tried my best and found some information from the Ministry of Revenue,

494
00:31:52,939 --> 00:31:56,380
but I just don't know the reason behind it.

495
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,379
A copper coin from Qian Printing.

496
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,080
Eunuch Qin.

497
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:08,470
Eunuch Qin, His Majesty just gave an order.

498
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,650
What is it?

499
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:21,900
Xue Rucheng will visit Qianzhou.

500
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,859
The Southwest will get chaotic.

501
00:32:26,859 --> 00:32:30,699
Xiao Jinyu went to looking for Xiao Heng.

502
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:34,699
But all he found was a copper coin from Qian Printing.

503
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:39,069
Xue Rucheng is also on his way there.

504
00:32:39,069 --> 00:32:40,870
His Majesty...

505
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:44,359
is contemplating ordering a marriage.

506
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,320
And there's Leng Peishan.

507
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,200
How interesting.

508
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,539
I'm free today.

509
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,749
So I want to play chess with you.

510
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,559
However, you went to the palace early in the morning.

511
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,709
I heard that you had a long conversation

512
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,570
with His Majesty at Jiangshan Hall?

513
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:10,740
Seems that nothing can escape Senior Jing's observation.

514
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,300
I have begged His Majesty

515
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,649
to allow me to visit the Southwest soon.

516
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,569
Commandery Prince An left the capital.

517
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,559
Her Grace is worried for him.

518
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,809
Her Grace came to visit me many times because of that.

519
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:30,749
Senior Jing, have you heard any news?

520
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,059
The situation in the Southwest is complicated.

521
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:35,409
I'm worried that His Highness might be in an adverse situation.

522
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,869
Yes.

523
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,879
Commandery Prince An is discreet.

524
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:44,749
But they had no experience working with local officers.

525
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,509
This indeed makes us worried.

526
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,980
Senior Jing, you're right.

527
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:54,620
Illegal copper coin case involves many parties.

528
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:58,489
Commandery Prince An hasn't reported to the imperial court yet.

529
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,229
I don't know if he's found out anything yet.

530
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:07,269
I'm worried that if the Leng family from the Southwest is involved in it...

531
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:11,829
Commandery Prince An has always been prudent.

532
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,709
He won't put himself in danger.

533
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,459
That's right.

534
00:34:16,459 --> 00:34:20,269
Their trip to the Southwest is for Prince Consort.

535
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:24,529
If they can find Prince Consort, who has been missing for years,

536
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,329
then the thousand-mile trip wasn't made in vain.

537
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:29,279
I'm afraid it won't be that easy.

538
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,580
Senior Jing, what are you worried about?

539
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,029
Nothing.

540
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,949
I was just thinking if it's that easy,

541
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:40,031
we should have heard the news about Prince Consort sooner.

542
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,980
[Guanling Yamen]

543
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,770
Your Highness.

544
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,369
How's Chu He doing?

545
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:03,229
Leng Yue said he's fine. She went to buy medicine for him.

546
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,400
Chu Chu, go home first.

547
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,739
But my brother...

548
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:16,129
Chu Chu, don't worry. We're here.

549
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,919
He's said to be fine, right?

550
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,070
You should go home and tell your family that he's safe.

551
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:31,130
Miss Chu, let me take you home.

552
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,459
I'm not going.

553
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,529
I have to wait for my brother to wake up.

554
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:38,839
If I go home and tell them my brother is still in a coma, they will be worried.

555
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,819
You must go home when I ask you to.

556
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:46,079
If you really see yourself as the coroner of Three Judicial Offices,

557
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,819
you must follow my orders.

558
00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:49,979
If you think of my words as unworthy of your attention,

559
00:35:49,979 --> 00:35:52,670
you shouldn't keep working for me.

560
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:55,451
Three Judicial Offices will be fine with one less coroner.
