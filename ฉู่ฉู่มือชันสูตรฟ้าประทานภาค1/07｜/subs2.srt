You have to give him leads and let him explore on his own.

184
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,810
Once he finds the things he likes in you,

185
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,920
he'll definitely keep you by his side.

186
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,160
The things he likes?

187
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,780
Your Highness, this is how far I can help you.

188
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,490
I've apologized to Academician Xue for you.

189
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,880
He took accountability for you.

190
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,130
That's your fault.

191
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,240
Though you're an important minister in the Imperial Court now,

192
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,560
you're still inexperienced.

193
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,180
From now on, you should listen to

194
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,700
Academician Xue's opinions more often.

195
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,020
Yes.

196
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,510
I got it.

197
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,100
Yesterday, Madam Jing came to me

198
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,569
and told me that Leng Yue will return.

199
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:31,270
Do you know that?

200
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,180
Greetings, Your Grace.

201
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,199
Rise.

202
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,600
Yes.

203
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,349
Your Highness, Vice Minister Jing's men just reported.

204
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,800
He's handled the things as you ordered.

205
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,610
He'll report to Three Judicial Chief Ministries after freshening up.

206
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,810
Okay.

207
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,199
I'm a bit busy with work.

208
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,500
Mother, I'll visit you another day.

209
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,050
Go ahead.

210
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,060
[Three Judicial Chief Minitries]

211
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,380
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

212
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,040
Take this beggar to eat something first.

213
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,830
Interrogate him later.

214
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,879
Did you hear it?

215
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,010
You're lucky that you're in the hands of His Highness.

216
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,710
Come with me.

217
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,150
Yes.

218
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,450
Get up!

219
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,229
You? What do you kidnap me for?

220
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,370
He's the one who robbed me.

221
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,740
His Highness has many rules.

222
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,440
No one is allowed to eat in any of those rooms.

223
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,640
You have to make do with this spot.

224
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,490
Thanks.

225
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,150
What? You need chopsticks?

226
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,150
No. No.

227
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,229
Beggars like us are satisfied as long as we have food.

228
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,010
We're not that fussy.

229
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,350
Look at the way you're dressed.

230
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,150
You seem to be a scholar.

231
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,580
Yes.

232
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,999
These were left by my ancestors.

233
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,999
I just retrieved them from the pawnshop.

234
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,860
I met that beggar the moment I stepped out of the door.

235
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,300
I gave him food out of kindness.

236
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,280
But he tried to rob me.

237
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,440
Recite the chapter Moral

238
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,440
- Cultivation from The Great Learning.
- This...

239
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,040
Well. You've been learning for years,

240
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,800
and you can't even recite The Four Books?

241
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,639
I... I've quit learning for a while.

242
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,210
How do you make a living then?

243
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,219
I'm an accountant now.

244
00:14:53,219 --> 00:14:55,320
For which shop?

245
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,620
- For a foreign caravan.
- A foreign caravan.

246
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,150
They left Chang'an a while ago.

247
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,820
- They sell fur pelts?
- Yes.

248
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,779
What are the market prices of goat fur, dear fur, and fox fur?

249
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,220
Which is the most popular kind in Chang'an?

250
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,520
Well...

251
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,900
I'm not in the mood for nonsense.

252
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,029
And you're not smart enough to fool me.

253
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,909
You killed Liu Yue, Director of the Ministry of Revenue,

254
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,369
Lu Chuansheng, Capital Liaison Representative of Qianzhou,

255
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:22,009
and Feng Jie, Minister of War.

256
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:24,340
The case has been solved.

257
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,550
What are you talking about?

258
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,780
I can't understand any of it.

259
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,980
Then, let me tell you something you can understand.

260
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,860
Now, Xu Rugui wants to silence you forever.

261
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,120
Will he spare your wife and kid?

262
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,590
You... How...?

263
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,010
How do I know?

264
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,810
Your wife and kid are now held hostage by Xu Rugui.

265
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,079
On your wrist, there are two strands of colored braids.

266
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,759
Women and kids wear those during the Dragon Boat Festival

267
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,450
to ward off evil spirits and disasters.

268
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,550
Judging from their color, they might be from two years ago.

269
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,300
You went to withdraw gold from the pawnshop

270
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,000
because you were prepared to flee.

271
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,480
But you still carried those with you.

272
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,020
It shows that they're as important as your life to you.

273
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,850
Even if you die,

274
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,550
you'd die with them.

275
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,380
Where do you usually beg?

276
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,750
In the streets. Anywhere I go.

277
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,810
I made a bad choice today.

278
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,540
I wished to rob a fortune so I could live an abundant life.

279
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,560
I'll never do it again.

280
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,530
Don't rush. Just eat.

281
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,250
Haven't you heard His Highness?

282
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,430
Let's talk after you're full.

283
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,040
I'm just curious.

284
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,680
What do you often eat?

285
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,810
We live off the scraps of every tavern.

286
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,330
We eat everything we can find.

287
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,250
So, you've had food from every tavern in the city, right?

288
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,340
Which is the best?

289
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,280
Guangtai Tavern, of course.

290
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,030
Then, how about Rugui Tarvern?

291
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,530
Last night, Xu Rugui fled in a hurry.

292
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:05,680
He may haven't had the chance to kill your wife and kid.

293
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,490
Now, it's up to you to decide their fate.

294
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,850
You can keep on wasting time with me.

295
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,480
Or you can tell everything honestly.

296
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,700
It's your decision.

297
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,700
You can really find them?

298
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,039
It depends on whether you tell the truth or not.

299
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,540
I'll tell you everything.

300
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,680
Vice Minister Jing.

301
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,180
General Wu.

302
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,900
Vice Minister Jing, thanks for the hard work.

303
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,700
You too.

304
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,290
He knows where the killer's wife and kid are.

305
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,320
His Highness is so miraculous.

306
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,030
He's done with the interrogation before we can finish the meal.

307
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,460
Hurry up.

308
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,480
I'm waiting for you to have a drink tonight.

309
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,579
Enjoy your meal.

310
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:56,640
Your next meal will be your last one before execution.

311
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,400
What do you mean?

312
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,850
I was just being too hotheaded.

313
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,790
The robbery was unsuccessful either.

314
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,780
Lord, please spare my life.

315
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,200
I'll never do it again.

316
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,460
What robbery?

317
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,250
You're so tricky.

318
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,960
Don't try to cover up the true crime.

319
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,340
Listen. You'll be executed because you committed murder.

320
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,730
The other man has confessed everything.

321
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,130
You plotted against his wealth and life.

322
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,250
You want to kill him and his family.

323
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,329
You just saw it, didn't you?

324
00:18:22,329 --> 00:18:24,540
He has confessed everything under His Highness's interrogation.

325
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,339
- Fine. Take him back.
- Yes!

326
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,440
My Lord, please be investigate.

327
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,799
I didn't kill his family.

328
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,250
He's the killer.

329
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,549
Trust me. Don't listen to his nonsense.

330
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:37,159
Whether he's the murderer or not has nothing to do with your killing his family.

331
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,160
I'm only responsible for your case.

332
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,679
Tonight, I'll stay up late and archive your case

333
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,399
so they can execute you tomorrow at noon.

334
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,600
My Lord!

335
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,700
Vice Minister Jing. Please be investigate.

336
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,399
I really didn't kill his family.

337
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,850
His wife and kid are still alive.

338
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,559
Let him go.

339
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,860
Yes.

340
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,460
It's real?

341
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,320
Yes, it's true.

342
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,460
Two years ago, on the day of the Dragon Boat Festival,

343
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,320
Xu Rugui suddenly kidnapped my wife and son,

344
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,330
and he came to me with these two braids my wife made.

345
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,300
He said he found me a job where I could earn a fortune.

346
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,700
If I refuse,

347
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,920
I can never see them again.

348
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,960
Besides Liu Yue, Lu Chuansheng, and Feng Jie,

349
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,940
who else have you killed?

350
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,190
I kill one or two people from time to time.

351
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:34,120
I didn't dare to inquire about the victims' identities.

352
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,500
Did Xu Rugui ever tell you

353
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,760
the reason for killing them?

354
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,940
He never told me.

355
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,279
He never allowed me to ask either.

356
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,830
Have you seen Xu Rugui interact

357
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,080
with people from Shen Army?

358
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,610
Sometimes, I saw Shen Army members drink at Rugui Tavern.

359
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,900
I know nothing beyond that.

360
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,970
The Dancing Service's dancer, Lady Liu.

361
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,170
Is she with on this side?

362
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,610
No, I've never heard of her.

363
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,190
I just follow Xu Rugui's orders.

364
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,720
I really don't know the rest.

365
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:09,010
Oh, yes. As for the most recent murder case, it should be carried out by me

366
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,660
and another guy together.

367
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,060
It's more secretive if it's conducted by both of us.

368
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,020
But that guy was missing half a month ago.

369
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,530
So I committed the recent three murders all on my own.

370
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,530
Can you describe this person's look?

371
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,990
Yes.

372
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,799
Tell me.

373
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,100
Yes.

374
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,480
Miss Chu, what are you doing?

375
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,540
I'm making a mirror.

376
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,799
Make a mirror with this?

377
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,349
There are many bronze mirrors in the mansion.

378
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,479
I can get you the ones you want.

379
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:46,980
No. No need.

380
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,930
Three Judicial Chief Ministries definitely doesn't have a mirror like this.

381
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,190
Miss Leng, you're back?

382
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,919
Are you the coroner who probed His Highness's body
[Leng Yue]

383
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,680
and even tried to take off his clothes?
[Leng Yue]

384
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,700
Who are you?

385
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,350
Miss Chu, this is—

386
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,799
Don't mind who I am.

387
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,210
Answer me first. Is that you?

388
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,050
Yes, it's me.

389
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:15,460
But I did it because of the exam...

390
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,410
So, it's real.

391
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,920
I thought Wu Jiang and Jing Yi made that up to fool me.

392
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,690
You look quite pretty.

393
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,069
But aren't you a coroner?

394
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,279
Why are you here polishing a spoon?

395
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,350
I'm not polishing a spoon.

396
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,470
Who on earth are you?

397
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,110
Guess.

398
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,480
You're so pretty.

399
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,530
You can't be an average person.

400
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,480
I haven't washed my face or changed my clothes in three days.

401
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,210
How can you say I'm pretty?

402
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,710
I've never seen a woman as beautiful as you.

403
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:56,070
Really, can you elaborate?

404
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,189
Your features are in neat positions.

405
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,570
You have clear shapes,

406
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:11,800
perfectly shaped jawlines, and sleek neck bones.

407
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,450
You have broad shoulders, a slim waist,

408
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:17,230
powerfully built thighs and fit lower legs.

409
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:21,750
You have the strength that's rarely seen on other women.

410
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,620
If I were a man, I would wish to marry you.

411
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,350
Your Highness.

412
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,540
You're forgetting your manners.

413
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,690
No, I'm not.

414
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,850
Your coroner just said that

415
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,730
she would marry me.

416
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,110
I...

417
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,320
Don't even try to take it back.

418
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,560
I have an eye-witness.

419
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,700
Fine. Lian Qiao, take her to freshen up

420
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,180
and wait for me at Ten Commandment Hall.

421
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,680
Yes.

422
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,820
I'm waiting for you to marry me.

423
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,040
Your Highness, who is she?

424
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:18,280
She's the granddaughter of Leng Peishan, the Military Commissioner of Qianzhou.

425
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,300
Her name is Leng Yue.

426
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,380
She's always like this. She doesn't really mean what she says.

427
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,160
I'm sorry if she offended you.

428
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,780
Why are you polishing a spoon here?

429
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,540
No, I'm not.

430
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,520
I just...

431
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,760
Are you here for me?

432
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,280
Can you write autopsy sheets?

433
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,209
Yes, my grandfather taught me.

434
00:23:43,209 --> 00:23:46,229
Although writing autopsy sheets are the job of clerks,

435
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,279
coroners have to know it too.

436
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,940
Otherwise, if clerks write nonsense and put coroners' names on it,

437
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,680
coroners will be the ones blamed.

438
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:01,759
Do you still remember the findings of the autopsies on Feng Jie, Liu Yue, and Lu Chuansheng?

439
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:04,410
Yes. As long as I'm the one who inspected the bodies,

440
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,509
I won't forget.

441
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:09,710
Okay. I'll send someone to give you the autopsy sheets later.

442
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:13,790
Fill those sheets and hand them in to me.

443
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:19,039
Also, don't fill in the blanks for the names of the recorder and the coroner.

444
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,990
I get it.

445
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,130
Don't worry. Don't rush.

446
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:40,150
I can fill in my name when I become the official coroner.

447
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:43,070
I'll definitely become the official coroner.

448
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,929
Senior Jing. As for His Majesty's conferment decree for Minister Feng,

449
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:54,780
I've come up with a few posthumous names.

450
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,490
Are these appropriate?

451
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,540
Last night, the mourning hall of Feng's Manor caught fire.

452
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,540
I heard you were at the scene.

453
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,860
Yes. I was afraid that things might go wrong.

454
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,209
So, I took a look.

455
00:25:05,209 --> 00:25:06,469
I happened to meet Commandery Prince An.

456
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,320
He was there to apologize at the behest of His Majesty.

457
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,460
He had some misunderstanding with Feng's Family.

458
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,610
I was worried someone might take advantage of that situation.

459
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,480
So I stayed and handled it.

460
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,700
There was another incident last night.

461
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,580
I don't know if you've heard of it.

462
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,820
Are you referring to the close-down of Rugui Tavern?

463
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,949
Yes.

464
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:26,230
I only heard the rumors.

465
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:31,219
His Majesty summoned royal members and beloved ministers to the palace for the tea gathering today.

466
00:25:31,219 --> 00:25:34,510
Bring up Feng Jie's conferment decree at a later date.

467
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,359
Don't spoil His Majesty's good mood.

468
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,180
[Memorial]

469
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,200
I understand.

470
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,950
Stand up.

471
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,230
Chief.

472
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,610
It seems that your skills are improved a lot during the last year.

473
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,610
You've made so many delicate gadgets.

474
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,229
This is the Three Judicial Chief Ministries.

475
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,589
Address me properly.

476
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,830
Don't be a bad influence on my men.

477
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,019
I've been calling you that since I was little. It's hard to change.

478
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:15,200
Moreover, there's nobody else here anyway.

479
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,400
All right. All right.

480
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,030
Your Highness.

481
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,799
Where's Jing Yi?

482
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,880
Why isn't he here?

483
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,780
Without him being a reference object,

484
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,900
you can't really see how sweet I am.

485
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,300
Thank you. Thank you very much.

486
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,900
Honey!

487
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,740
Good to see you're all right.

488
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,560
Yes, I'm fine.

489
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,380
Why did you come back to Chang'an suddenly?

490
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,400
What? You are fed up with the colorful world?

491
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,620
Not really.

492
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,730
Chang'an is also part of the colorful world.

493
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:06,380
And there is always new stuff to see out there. How can I be fed up?

494
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,679
But the news about you was more interesting.

495
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:11,990
Wu Jiang told me in the letter that you were almost stripped by a girl.

496
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,729
Of course I had to come back.

497
00:27:13,729 --> 00:27:16,130
I asked him to ask you about the Handsome Judge in the letter.

498
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,390
And he told you those irrelevant stuff.

499
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,740
You can't blame him for that.

500
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,349
If he hadn't told me, I wouldn't have known if what I got

501
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,459
were the things you wanted to know.

502
00:27:25,459 --> 00:27:26,729
What information did you get then?

503
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:29,060
I've asked all my friends,

504
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,430
but nobody has heard of somebody called Handsome Judge.

505
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,799
So I asked them to investigate something else.

506
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,589
What?

507
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:39,260
Recently, I've been thinking about the girl's background.

508
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,880
Although locals say that she was a sideslip of his father.

509
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,520
But according to my friends in Qianzhou,

510
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,779
her father, Chu Ping, is definitely not such an indecent person.

511
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:49,849
Are you sure?

512
00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:53,270
Chu family members are all honest.

513
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,679
And people tend to avoid contact with coroners.

514
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,430
So, normally, they don't deal with other people much

515
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:02,250
other than doing their works.

516
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,919
Earlier, when that girl left her home

517
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,229
for Chang'an for the Coroner Qualification Exam,

518
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:09,810
her family asked a trade caravan to take care of her.

519
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:13,129
And Chu He, her older brother, escorted her all the way out of Qianzhou

520
00:28:13,129 --> 00:28:14,910
before he headed back home.

521
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:18,510
If you ask me, judging by the way they treated her,

522
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,560
it didn't look like she was a sideslip.

523
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,650
That doesn't make sense then.

524
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:26,620
If she's the daughter of Chu Ping and his wife,

525
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,430
and they treasure her that much,

526
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,999
why didn't they come out and make clarifications for her,

527
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,159
rather than letting the rumors spread?

528
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,870
Maybe they are just magnanimous and don't care about it at all.

529
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,810
During your year out there,

530
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:47,020
have you ever been to Qianzhou?

531
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:51,860
You know clearly that Qianzhou is the last place I would go.

532
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,210
Your Highness, Miss Chu is here.

533
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,639
And she has something for you.

534
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,060
Have her wait outside for a bit.

535
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,560
Yes.

536
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,949
Who did you tell about coming back to Chang'an?

537
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,430
I only told you in the letter.

538
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,900
[Breathing Clear Air Makes You Calm]

539
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,590
Please.

540
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,730
Please wait here for a minute.

541
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,070
What is this?

542
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,309
I told you not to touch anything.

543
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,990
That's paint.

544
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,410
Use this.

545
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,270
Go wash your hand with some alcohol.

546
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,990
You've finished the autopsy sheet?

547
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,800
I… I…

548
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,489
I didn't mean it.

549
00:30:09,489 --> 00:30:11,190
I'll go fill another one.

550
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,590
Come back.

551
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,270
Don't panic. Give it to me.

552
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,930
It's fine as long as I can read it.

553
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,560
[Autopsy Sheet]

554
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,539
It's good. Come with me.

555
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,380
This is your stipend for examining those three bodies.

556
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,209
Stipend? No, no, no.

557
00:30:40,209 --> 00:30:41,329
This is too much.

558
00:30:41,329 --> 00:30:44,379
I didn't get this much the last time when I examined Lord Yan Ming's body.

559
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:47,279
To examine Feng Jie's body, you almost lost your life to the fire.

560
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,589
You suffered for it.

561
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:51,740
And you provided many clues for arresting Xu Rugui.

562
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,849
You earned this.

563
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:54,229
Those were all my duties.

564
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,150
This is also my duty.

565
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,720
Thank you, Your Highness.

566
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,460
Your Highness, can I ask you a question?

567
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,890
Ask away.

568
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:17,050
Do you like beautiful girls?

569
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,080
Of course.

570
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,530
So this must be what Lord Jing meant

571
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,740
when he said "cater to his pleasure".

572
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,579
The so-called beautiful girls are those who make you feel pleased.

573
00:31:27,579 --> 00:31:30,519
Otherwise, they would not be deemed beautiful.

574
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,660
Of course, I like girls that make me feel pleased.

575
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,559
Your question is pretty weird.

576
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,500
What do you want to ask really?

577
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,800
I…

578
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,820
Nothing.

579
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,720
I also want to know

580
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,129
if the results of the qualification exam and the selecting test are out.

581
00:31:50,129 --> 00:31:53,699
Now that you paid me, does that mean I'm already selected?

582
00:31:53,699 --> 00:31:55,969
I paid you because you did your work.

583
00:31:55,969 --> 00:31:57,489
It has nothing to do with the exam.

584
00:31:57,489 --> 00:32:00,210
Nobody's selected yet through the selecting exam.

585
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,329
What about the qualification exam?

586
00:32:02,329 --> 00:32:03,939
You are from Qianzhou.

587
00:32:03,939 --> 00:32:06,949
Chang'an can't verify your background in a short while.

588
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:10,349
According to the rules, whatever your result may be,

589
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,440
you can't get a qualification right now.

590
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,760
How come?

591
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,829
- Your Highness.
- Come in.

592
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,919
Your Highness.

593
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,909
Jing Yi drafted this wanted notice according to the portrait you drew.

594
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:26,290
He's in a hurry to go to the palace, so he asked me to send it to you.

595
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,759
Isn't this the man who was struck by lightning and then burned to death?

596
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:38,969
He's already dead.

597
00:32:38,969 --> 00:32:40,209
How can he still be wanted?

598
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:42,470
The corpse is totally burned,

599
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,129
how can you recognize his face?

600
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:48,410
Even if his face was burnt, the bones are still intact.

601
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,819
What a person's face looks like

602
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:51,999
has a lot to do with the brow ridges.
[Brow ridge Skull]

603
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,519
His eyebrows are different from yours,

604
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,639
General Wu's, and mine.
[Different eyebrow shapes]

605
00:32:57,639 --> 00:33:00,039
It's because the shapes of our brow ridges are different.

606
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:04,700
The brow ridge is an arch-shaped bony ridge above the eye socket.

607
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,559
This is that person.

608
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,060
I'm sure of it.

609
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,279
That explains all.

610
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,210
He was badly burned, but I could feel that

611
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:17,879
he had fractures in his ribs, arms and shanks.

612
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,659
No matter what a bad temper he had,

613
00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:22,359
he wouldn't fight people desperately almost every day,

614
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:25,109
unless that was his job!

615
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,740
You were right.

616
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,660
This man had a life-risking job. He's a killer.

617
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,210
A killer?

618
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,809
- Wu Jiang.
- Your Highness.

619
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:36,589
Replace this wanted notice with a missing person notice

620
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,109
and send it to Jingzhao government office.

621
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:41,519
Let them post it and see if he had any family.

622
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,820
Yes, Your Highness.

623
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,070
Your Highness, what's going on here?

624
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,519
Half a month ago, he disguised himself as a drunk

625
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,080
and slipped me a note while I was out on an errand,

626
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,309
He said he'd reveal to me a murder of a court official

627
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,400
that had not happened yet.

628
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,279
In exchange, he wanted me to guarantee his safety.

629
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,299
On that note, he asked me to meet him at a sesame oil shop in the West Market.

630
00:34:08,299 --> 00:34:09,759
On that day, I waited until the market closed,

631
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,380
but he never showed up.

632
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,130
Sesame oil?

633
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:21,019
I remember, before he died, he was carrying some sesame oil, right?

634
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:23,410
Yes, maybe he was there that day.

635
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:26,709
But before I arrived, he was found by the people who hired him.

636
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:29,469
So he ran into the woods outside the city, trying to hide.

637
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,119
But he was struck by lightning

638
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,980
and his lantern accidentally ignited the sesame oil.

639
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,010
Just like what you've figured out.

640
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:42,130
Chu Chu, what else can we find out from a badly burned corpse?

641
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:44,799
It's hard to say.

642
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,379
Before the death of each victim, what they were thinking and doing are different,

643
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,229
so each corpse is also different.

644
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:54,430
I can only tell when I see the corpse.

645
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,300
Y-Your Highness?

646
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,909
I have something I'd like you to take a look at.

647
00:35:01,909 --> 00:35:03,560
What is it?

648
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,150
This is...

649
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,890
Do you recognize this man?

650
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:25,680
- On his left arm, is there a burn like this?
- I...

651
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,519
This is the person who gave you the pendant, isn't it?

652
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,020
Yes...

653
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,640
No, no, I...

654
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,599
Tell me!

655
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,130
Where is he now?

656
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,980
I don't know who you're talking about.

657
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,140
Your Highness.

658
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:39,839
What is it?

659
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,819
- Someone is here from the palace.
- The palace?

660
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,890
Why did I tell him that?

661
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,820
I'm so stupid. So stupid!

662
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,119
How did he know?

663
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,949
How does he know everything?

664
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,469
Is he the Handsome Judge or not?

665
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,510
What if he's not?

666
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,580
Greetings, Commandery Prince An.

667
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,329
Eunuch Qin, as you were. What is it?

668
00:36:18,329 --> 00:36:22,189
I'm here to deliver a message from His Majesty

669
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:26,389
that you're invited to the banquet today.

670
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,020
Please report to His Majesty

671
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,039
that I'm quite engaged in Three Judicial Chief Ministries,

672
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,949
and I'm afraid I couldn't attend today.

673
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:36,759
Commandery Prince An, His Majesty has specifically instructed that

674
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,049
I have to take you to the palace even if I have to force you.

675
00:36:41,049 --> 00:36:43,669
But of course, if you don't want to go,

676
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,909
I wouldn't dare to offend you.

677
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:50,850
It'll be my honor if I'm punished because of this.

678
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,629
But if you don't go today,

679
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:59,360
His Majesty is worried that someone will eat you.

680
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,629
I don't know what that means.

681
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:05,530
If anyone is confident that they can take it,

682
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,900
just come and eat.

683
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:12,149
By the way, Princess Xiping and Academician Xue

684
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,189
are summoned to the palace, too.

685
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:19,799
Commandery Prince An, if His Majesty hears this reply from you

686
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,460
and gets furious,

687
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,519
I'm afraid it's not going to be easy for you.

688
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,640
Thank you for reminding me.

689
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,470
Please, Eunuch Qin.

690
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,430
I'll take my leave now.
