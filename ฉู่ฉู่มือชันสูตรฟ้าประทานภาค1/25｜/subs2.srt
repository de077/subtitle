The mold is consumable.

You are afraid to be found out if you make it in your mansion.

So you came here to make the mold every once in a while.

12
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:52,600
As a prefect, you've put a lot of effort into this.

General, I'm afraid it will take a few hours to clear a way out.

It's humid inside the cave.

27

The gunpowder wouldn't work due to dampness if it was installed a long time ago.

28
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:32,220
It must have been installed recently.

- Where's Commandery Prince An?

What about Li Zhang? Is he also trapped inside?

146
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,740
They are all inside. The front entrance has been blocked by falling rocks.

Neither of them knows how to fight. I don't know how long they can hang in there.

I just saw some ruts on the ground.

150
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,589
This should be the way they used to send things in and out.

00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,269
We should be able to find them soon following these traces.

152

Qianzhou's cave is complicated.

153
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,269
Adjacent caves are often connected to each other.

154
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,709
This should be the other entrance.

155
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,710
Let's go inside.

All right. I'm finished.

157
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,930
The way you tied him is different from how the prisoners are tied.

158
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,490
I seem to have seen it before.

159
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,659
- Your Highness, have you seen people selling live pigs at the market?
- Selling pigs?

160
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:17,189
Yeah. This is how pigs are tied.

161
00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:19,299
This is called a trotter knot.

162
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,050
He can't break loose no matter how hard he unties.

163
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,850
The knot will only get tighter.

164
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,589
It's also easy to get him out of here after we find the exit.

165
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:31,129
We only need a shoulder pole and get two people to carry him down the mountain.

166
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,260
You are thoughtful indeed.

167
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,419
Let's go to find the exit.

168
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,999
Your Highness, can we find the exit?

169
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,529
Yes. I have never seen a cave like this,

170
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:46,659
but I have seen a lot of people like Li Zhang.

171
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:52,690
He came here at the last minute must be because there is a way out.

172
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,199
I acted on impulse and beat him too hard.

173
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,850
I'm afraid he won't wake up for a while.

174
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,200
Otherwise, we can ask him.

175
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,469
He can't be trusted even he told us.

176
00:13:03,469 --> 00:13:05,419
It's more convenient for us to find the exit on our own

177
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,749
than asking him to lead the way.

178
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,540
If he can take you out, I can also take you out.

179
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,530

It's gunpowder.

181
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:39,149
Looks like they used this

182
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,979
to transport the gunpowder to the cave over there.

183
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,559
Then they would hide and wait for us to come.

184
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,220
So they can attack us.

185
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,689
Damn Li Zhang.

186
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,270
He used his little brain to do these utterly conscienceless things.

187
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,689
This is easy now.

188
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,829
If he used this cart to transport the gunpowder,

189
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:57,029
we only need to follow the ruts, and then we can find them. Right?

190
00:13:57,029 --> 00:13:58,519
Do you think they are stupid?

191
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,519
The ruts at the entrance have been cleared.

192
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,229
What if they faked the ruts on purpose to lead us to a dangerous place?

193
00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:06,009
We have to find them even it's dangerous!

194
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,789
Those who are afraid should get out of here now.

195
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,370
Don't be garrulous and disturb us.

196
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,929
Xiao Jinli, who are you talking about?

197
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:12,099
Who do you think I'm talking about?

198
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,129
- You...!
- Xiao Jinli.

199
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:15,639
Leng Yue is just analyzing the situation.

200
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,249
She is not wrong. What are you doing?

201
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:20,379
And you. You can only talk and make trouble for us.

202
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:22,899
Xiao Jinli, are you a dog? Don't bite everyone you see.

203
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:24,609
- I'll just bite you. So what?
- Go ahead and bite me!

204
00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:26,609
All right, stop fighting.

205
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,999
We are all here for Commandery Prince An and Chu Chu.

206
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:31,929
- Confucius said...
- Let's go.

207
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,880
What did I tell you?

208
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,739
He's bad-tempered.

209
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,589
He would become like a nut when it's about his brother.

210
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,240
All right. Don't let him get to you.

211
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,239
Confucius is right about this. He said...

212
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,280
Saint Confucius is the best weapon to deal with fighters.

213
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,270
Wait for me!

214
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,750
You are not afraid of dead people, but you are afraid of mice.

215
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,830
Dead people won't come out of nowhere suddenly.

216
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,050
It's showing us the way.

217
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,000
You just yelled out and scared it into the hole.

218
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,370
Yeah, I remember it.

219
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:30,150
Snakes, insects, rats, and ants know where the exit is.

220
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,190
Let's go.

221
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,289
General Xiao! There are wagon tracks.

222
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:37,190
It should be in this way.

223
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,660
This way.

224
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,640
Let's go.

225
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,500
Leng Yue, why should we go this way?

226
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,200
There are no ruts here,

227
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,740
but there are traces this way that has been swept by branches.

228
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,389
Only one would come here

229
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,230
to sweep the road unless they have other intentions.

230
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,179
Your Highness, hold on.

231
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,389
What's wrong?

232
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,709
There seems to be wind here.

233
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:16,349
Wind?

234
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,740
Yes, usually the place with the wind is the place with the exit.

235
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,349
What's wrong?

236
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,690
Are you not asking me to hug you?

237
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,940
I'm trying to tell the wind direction.

238
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,410
What are you doing behind me?

239
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,419
I just want to know what you are doing.

240
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,869
I'm trying to tell the wind direction.

241
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:27,390
Wind direction?

242
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,629
Heat your hands and spread your arms.

243
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,520
The hand that cools quickly shows the wind direction.

244
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,360
The entrance is blocked, but it's still ventilated.

245
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,470
There must be a way to the entrance.

246
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,700
This way.

247
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,590
This way.

248
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,570
This way.

249
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,510
There is the sound of running water here.

250
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,629
- What's wrong?
- Normally, the closer we are to the exit, it should be windier

251
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,059
and less humid.

252
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:41,559
The stone wall should be drier.

253
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:45,589
But on the way here, the stone wall is still very humid.

254
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,299
It doesn't seem to be changing.

255
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,060
Maybe it's because of the rainy days recently.

256
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,970
Your Highness, look.

257
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,850
There is water on the ground.

258
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:10,020
Chu Chu, does the Yong'an River run under here?

259
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,640
Yes.

260
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,509
No wonder the stone wall is always damp.

261
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:17,730
The explosion just now should have shattered the rocks.

262
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,770
This river is about to seep in.

263
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,299
It's gunpowder.

264
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,799
This should be the way Li Zhang took to bring gunpowder in.

265
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:41,439
We are in the right direction.

266
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,620
There must be an exit in front.

267
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,410
Chu Chu, we should hurry up.

268
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:07,030
Your Highness, it's Miss Leng. They came to find us.

269
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,330
Jinyu!

270
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,629
Your Highness! Chu Chu!

271
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:12,039
Your Highness, are you okay?

272
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,200
Jinli!

273
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,120
We need to save them now.

274
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,600
This bridge must have been broken by the falling rocks.

275
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,409
We need to get them here now.

276
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:20,969
Jing Yi, can you fly over there?

277
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,059
I can fly over there by myself.

278
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,820
But I'm afraid I can't bring them back.

279
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,849
I'll ask them to build a bridge with boards now!

280
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:30,139
That would be too late. The water is rising under the rocks.

281
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:33,399
- This place will collapse soon. It's too late.
- What should we do then?

282
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,779
Jinli, do you have any rope?

283
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,709
- Rope?
- Yes!

284
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:40,360
- Use the rope as a bridge!
- Bridge?

285
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,359
- Did you forget the bridge of rope in Guanling County?
- Yeah, you are right.

286
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:47,060
- Hurry up and get the rope! Hurry up!
- Yes!

287
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,630
Your Highness, take this.

288
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,610
Your Highness, let's go.

289
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,900
Chu Chu, hold me tight.

290
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,010
Chu Chu!

291
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,539
- Jinyu!
- Chu Chu!

292
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,140
Chu Chu...

293
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,630
How should we do?

294
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,970
Chu Chu.

295
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,250
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

296
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,240
- Are you okay, Jinyu?
- I'm fine.

297
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,790
- Are you all right?
- Jinyu, are you all right?

298
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,239
It's collapsing here. Let's go now.

299
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:14,840
Come on.

300
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,440
Hurry!

301
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,149
What's wrong? Are you okay?

302
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:34,250
I'm fine.

303
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,470
Chu Chu.
[Dislocated arm]

304
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,579
I'm fine.

305
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:40,109
That bastard Li Zhang, I'm going to...

306
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,710
By the way, where's Li Zhang?

307
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,869
We tied him up. He is in the cave on the other side of the kiln.

308
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,589
I don't know how he is doing now.

309
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,699
Jinli, please get some people to clean the entrance of the kiln and get Li Zhang out.

310
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:52,079
What? Get him out?

311
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,749
I can't wait to skin him alive!

312
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,879
Even you want to skin him alive, you still need to get him out first.

313
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,200
Li Zhang is an important witness.

314
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,249
And he is a small potato.

315
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:02,549
Considering what happened today, he failed it

316
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,549
and the person behind him won't let us go easily.

317
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,969
If we don't find out the person behind Li Zhang,

318
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,059
we will have more dangerous situations.

319
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:10,379
All right, I'll listen to you.

320
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:12,589
You guys escort Commandery Prince An and them back.

321
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:13,690
The rest of you come with me!

322
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,190
- Yes!
- Yes!

323
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,280
Let's go.

324
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,309
Didn't you go to the mountain?

325
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:31,579
Grandpa, it was my fault. I slipped

326
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:34,770
and dragged Commandery Prince An into a cave.

327
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:35,830
Are you all right?

328
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,730
I'm fine, Grandpa.

329
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,730
Wait, what's wrong with your arm?

330
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,940
It's nothing. I just strained it.

331
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,549
Strained it?

332
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:47,879
Let me see.

333
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:49,580
It doesn't matter.

334
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,889
You can't even move your arm.

335
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,629
Don't you know how serious it is?

336
00:23:55,629 --> 00:23:58,659
If you don't get treatment in time and let the wind into your bones,

337
00:23:58,659 --> 00:24:00,439
you will lose your arm.

338
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,909
Chu Chu, go and make some hot water. I'll take care of it.

339
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,910
Okay, I'm going.

340
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,150
Come on.

341
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,300
Okay.

342
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,249
Our families are coroners.

343
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:25,159
We often pull our muscles and hurt our bones when we carry stuff.

344
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,389
No one can treat this injury better than I can in Guanling County.

345
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,710
Bear with it later.

346
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,479
You can shout out if it hurts.

347
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,009
You can even cry. No one will laugh at you.

348
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:37,179
Yes.

349
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:38,999
But don't move.

350
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,139
Chu Chu, hold him up.

351
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:42,699
Don't let him move.

352
00:24:42,699 --> 00:24:45,410
Grandpa, do it gently.

353
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,530
How is it?

354
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,240
It doesn't seem to hurt anymore.

355
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,220
You look gentle and weak.

356
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,060
But you can endure some pain.

357
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,430
Thanks to your excellent medical skills. It doesn't hurt anymore.

358
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:27,609
All right, take some rest here for a few days. Don't use your arm.

359
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,449
You need to apply ointment for some days.

360
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,610
Get some rest. I'll go and get the medicine for you.

361
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,600
Thank you, Sir.

362
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,260
What's wrong?

363
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,840
It really doesn't hurt.

364
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,079
Don't lie to me. I'm a coroner.

365
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:52,050
What kind of injury you got, how you got hurt, I knew it at a glance.

366
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,359
I know how painful this is.

367
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,550
You got hurt because of me.

368
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:06,780
If I make you feel guilty for saving you, I would regret saving you.

369
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,809
Your Highness, your life is precious.

370
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:14,369
- It's not worth it to get hurt for me...
- There is only one you in the world.

371
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:20,640
If you die, I might not be able to find another good coroner like you,

372
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,680
but I can't find another you.

373
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,040
It's worth it anyway.

374
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,330
Your Highness.

375
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:41,300
All right, it's okay.

376
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,849
- Father, what are you doing here?
- Hush.

377
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:05,830
You know what, Commandery Prince An is sincere to Chu Chu.

378
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,820
Of course he is.

379
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,980
How can you eavesdrop on them at your age?

380
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,000
You little bastard.

381
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:39,759
Vice Minister Jing, you are back. Where's Commandery Prince An?

382
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,290
He is busy now. He will come back later.

383
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,840
How is it going with the tree hole?

384
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,340
Vice Minister Jing,

385
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,180
I took care of the tree hole as you ordered.

386
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,810
Then I came back to the County Office.

387
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:01,420
Vice Minister Jing, forgive me for asking this.

388
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,870
What did you do with Miss Leng?

389
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,750
I don't mean anything else.

390
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,300
I'm just worried about you.

391
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,380
I heard a loud bang from the mountain.

392
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,180
Should I send some people to take a look there

393
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:19,420
lest any villagers get hurt?

394
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,540
That's what you are talking about. It's fine.

395
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,829
A cave collapsed. No villager got hurt.

396
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:27,339
But Prefect Li got trapped inside accidentally.

397
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,849
Prefect Li is trapped in the cave?

398
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:33,159
Magistrate Zheng, don't worry. General Xiao went to save him.

399
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:34,569
You don't need to send anyone over there.

400
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:38,830
Just stay in the County Office and take care of the affairs here.

401
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,389
Yes. Yes.

402
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,360
I see.

403
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,249
He asked for the trouble himself.

404
00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:49,180
He won't blame you.

405
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,670
By the way, where is Deputy Magistrate Tan?

406
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,170
Vice Minister Jing.

407
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:56,269
Deputy Magistrate Tan had asked for leave for a funeral service days ago.

408
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,909
He hasn't come to the County Office.

409
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,789
Do you have any instructions?

410
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,440
Nothing. I'm just asking it.

411
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,249
You've worked hard these days. Go and rest early.

412
00:29:06,249 --> 00:29:11,429
Don't say that. It's my job.

413
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,219
How can you not tell me that you got hurt?

414
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,610
I'll tell General Xiao about it later and let him discipline you.

415
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:20,829
Chu Chu, never let my brother know this.

416
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:22,059
Then you need to promise me

417
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,759
that you will let me apply ointment for you on time,

418
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,660
and you will take medicine on time and rest on time.

419
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,429
You can't use any excuses to refuse it to delay it.

420
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,429
Okay, I promise you.

421
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:33,160
You must recover before you return to Chang'an.

422
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,420
Otherwise, when you get back to Chang'an and let your mother know it, she will be really worried.

423
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,410
I'll go to get more ointment from Grandpa later.

424
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:44,670
It's a long way to Chang'an. I should bring enough ointment.

425
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:50,529
Chu Chu, I'm afraid we can't go back to Chang'an for now.

426
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:52,710
Not going back to Chang'an?

427
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:56,229
But we have found out that Prefect Li is the one who was minting coins illegally.

428
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:58,269
Is there anyone else we need to arrest?

429
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:03,139
This group of people had a comprehensive plan to mint coins.

430
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,269
They hid it from the government for five years.

431
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:11,080
It can be seen that how cautious and composed the mastermind is.

432
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,600
But today, Li Zhang led us to the mint

433
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,960
and tried to bury us alive in the cave.

434
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,570
This is a hasty plan.

435
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,620
He acted so hastily.

436
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:26,030
It can be seen that we are very close to the truth.

437
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:28,039
Close to the truth?

438
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:31,239
Isn't Prefect Li the mastermind of this case?

439
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:34,359
Li Zhang is just a pawn.

440
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:39,680
For the real mastermind, it's good if his cave plan works out.

441
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:45,409
If not, he would be the scapegoat for closing the case.

442
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,750
Your Highness, you used to say these things to Vice Minister Jing.

443
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,670
Why are you telling me this today?

444
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:57,780
I used to think these disputes and conspiracies in court had nothing to do with you.

445
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,470
I didn't want to disturb your simple and happy mind.

446
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,709
But now you are already in this.

447
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,879
I have to tell you.

448
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,270
I will learn well.

449
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,670
I'm not asking you to learn it.

450
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:12,789
I tell you this now because I want you to be more cautious

451
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,080
and you will be safer.

452
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,599
This person who is causing waves in Qianzhou

453
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:20,799
won't stay put for too long.

454
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,779
Prefect Li is a high-ranking official but he is still not the mastermind.

455
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:28,360
Who can be the mastermind?

456
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:40,970
[Leng Peishan, Military Commissioner of Qianzhongdao]

457
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,250
Say it.

458
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,250
[Hou Bin, Deputy Military Commissioner Zhao Jie, Military Ambassador]

459
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,980
General Leng.

460
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,739
Since you received a letter from Miss Leng the day before yesterday, you've had so much on your mind.

461
00:32:01,739 --> 00:32:05,109
What happened? Let us share the worries for you.

462
00:32:05,109 --> 00:32:08,559
Yes, just make an order if you need us to do anything.

463
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,279
We will shrink from no sacrifice.

464
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,649
Yeah, shrink from no sacrifice!

465
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:20,260
This is the first letter she has ever written to me.

466
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:23,370
Is Miss Leng in trouble or in danger?

467
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:31,380
She wrote that she is doing well

468
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,460
and asked me

469
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,950
if I am doing well.

470
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:41,200
With her temperament...

471
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,910
it's very uncommon for her to write

472
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:51,490
such a common letter.

473
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:58,609
General Leng, could it be that Commandery Prince An knows our plan?

474
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,180
No way.

475
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,390
When Xiao Jinli was in the army,

476
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,799
he praised his little brother countless times.

477
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,439
He is basically a legend.

478
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,999
Not to mention he is in Qianzhou now.

479
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,349
Even if he is thousands of miles away,

480
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:15,060
it's not impossible for him to sense our affairs.

481
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,250
That's true.

482
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,820
Where's Xiao Jinli? Is he not back yet?

483
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:27,530
He took a group of people to move away the stones all night.

484
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,799
Li Zhang is troublesome indeed.

485
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,090
I hope Jinli can arrest him soon.

486
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,229
Then we can leave this poor place earlier.

487
00:33:35,229 --> 00:33:39,090
There are the same few dishes every day and night.

488
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:41,139
I miss the food in Rugui House.

489
00:33:41,139 --> 00:33:46,310
No matter how bad Li Zhang is, he still did us a favor.

490
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,510
Did us a favor?

491
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,729
Didn't you find out

492
00:33:49,729 --> 00:33:52,009
that Chu Chu and Commandery Prince An are totally different

493
00:33:52,009 --> 00:33:53,709
after they came out of the cave?

494
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:58,139
It means they must have solved all the problems that need to be solved.

495
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,470
We will be free if they are okay.

496
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,349
We should thank Li Zhang for that.

497
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,350
You have a point.

498
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:08,369
How about this? If Li Zhang gets out alive,

499
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:10,610
I'll treat him to his first meal.

500
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,210
Count me in.

501
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,469
It's the same.

502
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,849
What's our relationship? My treat is your treat.

503
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:17,099
What's our relationship?

504
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,100
We are...

505
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,460
We are sisters.

506
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,279
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

507
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:31,649
- Have you had breakfast? Should I get you a bowl and chopsticks?
- No need.

508
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:35,720
His Highness must have been fed by Chu Chu before he came out.

509
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,279
Your Highness.

510
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,870
Is Jinli back?

511
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,329
We were just talking about that.

512
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:45,419
If he doesn't come back later, I'm going to go to the mountain to check him.

513
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:48,239
This case is at a dead end now.

514
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:53,150
It's all right if Li Zhang is alive, but if he is dead,

515
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,269
when can we finish the investigation in Qianzhou

516
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:58,420
and go back to Chang'an to redress the old case?

517
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,020
Protect Lord!

518
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,820
Go!

♫  Only for you, I have to worry about the end of this life  ♫

530
00:37:42,549 --> 00:37:50,159
♫  I’m still young, with my love not yet realized for you, but I'm
willing to be here for you till the end

531
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:57,130
♫  You can rely on me in this lifetime  ♫

532
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:05,630
♫  Hope to spend this beautiful lifetime together  ♫
