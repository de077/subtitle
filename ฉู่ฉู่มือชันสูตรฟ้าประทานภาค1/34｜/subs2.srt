00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,160
Do you plead guilty?

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,739
Qin Luan killed the imperial doctor and framed Princess Xiping,

4
00:00:11,739 --> 00:00:15,309
trying to put Commandery Prince An and his family to death on the charge of deceiving the emperor.

5
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:18,979
Fortunately, His Highness and I found out the real cause of the imperial doctor's death

6
00:00:18,979 --> 00:00:21,750
and the murderer, Sun Mingde.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,399
With the eunuch's body hidden in the wall by my father being the evidence,

8
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,311
Qin Luan, you can't talk your way out of it this time.
[Domestic Service]

9
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:31,339
Xue Rucheng,

10
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:32,899
after I take down Qin Luan,

11
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:36,880
what other bargaining chip do you have to usurp the throne?

12
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,980
Chu Chu from the Three Judicial Offices greets Your Majesty.

13
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,810
Your Majesty, look.

14
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,080
She is the daughter of Yun Yi the rebel.

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,700
Eunuch Qin, how do you know that?

16
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,349
You've been long living in the palace.

17
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:04,659
When did you ever see her?

18
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:06,060
You...

19
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,069
Are you the female coroner taken in by Commandery Prince An?

20
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:16,930
- Yes.
- Raise your head.

21
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

22
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,760
Your Majesty,

23
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,829
Chu Chu's biological father, Yun Yi, was a general of the Military Commissioner of Jiannan.

24
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:30,739
I've found out the whole story of the Military Commissioner's case.

25
00:01:30,739 --> 00:01:35,059
To prevent Chu Chu from being murdered before I revealed the truth of this case,

26
00:01:35,059 --> 00:01:38,280
I decided to bring her to Chang'an in person

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,809
and report everything to Your Majesty.

28
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:42,540
Maybe it's the will of Heaven.

29
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,800
Chu Chu, get up and answer my question.

30
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,590
Chu Chu, whose body did you bring here?

31
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,919
Your Majesty.

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,459
It's the body of the eunuch who failed to assassinate Prince Consort

33
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:59,020
and it was sealed in a wall by Prince Consort.

34
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,469
The weapon Prince Consort used to fight with him was also sealed in the wall.

35
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:06,359
After verification, he was killed in an intense fight.

36
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,599
The wounds on his body match perfectly with the fighting process described in Prince Consort's letter.

37
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,900
Lift the shroud. I want to take a look.

38
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,930
This was found along with his body.

39
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,270
[Domestic Service]

40
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,900
- Qin Luan.
- Yes.

41
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,470
Show me your token.

42
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,080
Han Ji!

43
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,470
Your Majesty,

44
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,590
the token is not easy to forge,
[Domestic Service]

45
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,029
but some people can still forge it.

46
00:03:26,029 --> 00:03:30,419
- Your Majesty, please...
- The employment system was extremely strict

47
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,580
when Eunuch Ma was in charge of the Palace Domestic Service.

48
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,330
All the eunuchs' physical characteristics have been recorded.

49
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,640
Eunuch Qin.

50
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,230
You rule the Palace Domestic Service according to the old rules.

51
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,949
Before I came here, I asked someone to borrow the access register.

52
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:53,529
There was a person who died on the way to run some errands

53
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:56,890
matching with this eunuch.

54
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,740
- Qin Luan.
- Yes.

55
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,439
Didn't you say that Commandery Prince An was making up a story to frame you?

56
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,509
During the years when you were in charge of the Palace Domestic Service,

57
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:13,439
one of your subordinates killed an imperial doctor

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,180
and attempted to frame Princess Xiping, Commandery Prince An, and his brother.

59
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,180
Another one went to the Southwest to assassinate Xiao Heng.

60
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,430
Who is misleading us and calling white black?

61
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,369
- Guards!
- Yes!

62
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:29,239
Take Qin Luan into custody for trial.

63
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,740
Yes!

[Episode 34]

66
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,450
Han Ji.

67
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,510
Your Majesty.

68
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,540
As the Minister of Justice,

69
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,240
you failed to uphold justice and distinguish right from wrong.

70
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,250
I'll remove you from the Minister of Justice and demote you to a two-rank lower position.

71
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,959
Ponder over your mistakes in your room for half a month.

72
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:44,700
Come back to see me after you think it through!

73
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,620
Thank you, Your Majesty.

74
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,890
Commandery Prince An.

75
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,950
Sorry.

76
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,249
Qin Luan's case was a long time ago and it involves many parties.

77
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,759
Xiao Heng was also involved in it.

78
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,250
It's improper for his son to carry out the investigation.

79
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,379
Senior Jing, you are highly respected among the officials.

80
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:43,400
I'll let you take charge of the investigation.

81
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,939
The Ministry of Justice, the Censorate, the Court of Judicial Review,

82
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,719
and the Three Judicial Offices shall assist in the investigation.

83
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:50,289
You must find out what Qin Luan did

84
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,960
and every person who is involved in the case!

85
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,810
Yes, Your Majesty.

86
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,280
Senior Jing, Qin Luan's reaction was not quite right.

87
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,909
He must have prepared something.

88
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:12,510
Be careful.

89
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,390
Your Highness.

90
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,360
How is the plan going?

91
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,850
The news from Zhou Han

92
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:31,289
said that Qin Luan was counter-attacked by Xiao Jinyu and was arrested.

93
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:32,859
Then act on the plan.

94
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,360
Yes.

95
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,240
Where is Zhou Han?

96
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,220
Mother, you got frightened today because of me. It's my fault.

97
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,199
What are you doing?

98
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,180
Get up. Get up now.

99
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,750
You saved me today.

100
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,839
You also convinced the emperor to conduct a thorough investigation.

101
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,989
I should thank you two on behalf of Prince Consort,

102
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,639
the Chen clan, and the 20,000 loyal and righteous soldiers

103

of the Military Commissioner of Jiannan.

104
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,929
Your Grace, Prince Consort wore it all the time when he was alive.

105
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,149
He left it to me before he died.

106
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,250
Now it's time to give it to you.

107
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,099
Is this made of stone?

108
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:44,880
Yes, stone.

109
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,320
Where did you get the stone?

110
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,520
I picked it up by the koi pond in my house.

111
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,330
You are really frank.

112
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,920
I'm glad you are back.

113
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,580
You have suffered a lot along the way.

114
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,000
The traitors have been removed,

115
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,800
the truth will come to light one day.

116
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,330
Jinyu, there is one thing

117
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,889
I need to tell you now.

118
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:24,040
Mother, I know it.

119
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,580
I am a descendant of the Chen family.

120
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,280
How do you know it?

121
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,900
When Chu Chu first saw you at the Imperial Medical Service,

122
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,200
she knew you and Father were not my biological parents

123
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,350
from your looks.

124
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,109
Your Grace, His Highness asked me to tell him.

125
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,110
I couldn't lie to him.

126
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,639
You went through fire and water with Jinyu

127
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,600
and you always put Jinyu first.

128
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,090
How would I blame you?

129
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,900
Mother, please rest assured.

130
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,779
Before I came, Senior Jing asked me to tell you that he had asked the emperor.

131
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:00,599
If it was a miscarriage of justice

132
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,900
that you protected the descendant of a royal general. It's a good deed.

133
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,329
I don't care about that.

134
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:10,649
It's just I've been feeling guilty.

135
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:12,370
During all these years,

136
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,229
I couldn't let you fulfill your filial duties to your parents.

137
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,050
We had no choice back then.

138
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,329
Now that you know who your biological parents are,

139
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:28,010
you should worship them as their son.

140
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,800
I understand it.

141
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,020
I will serve incense in the mansion

142
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,290
to thank my parents for giving me my life.

143
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,539
Mother, if it weren't for you to save me

144
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:40,399
and to take good care of me for so many years,

145
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,120
there wouldn't be me now.

146
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,039
If my biological parents knew it,

147
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,220
they would also be grateful to you.

148
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,300
I still want to serve you just as before.

149
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,510
I don't know...

150
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,550
I don't know if you still want me to stay by your side.

151
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,540
Get up.

152
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,199
I never said I didn't want you.

153
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,810

00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,560
Since I entered the palace and started to serve Emperor Wenzong,

180
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,449
in the blink of an eye,

181
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:39,349
well, I've served three emperors.

182
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:46,789
By the way, you also became an official during the time of Emperor Wenzong, right?

183
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:51,969
I remember it was the second year of Taihe.

184
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,160
Eunuch Qin, your memory is good indeed.

185
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,200
I wouldn't say that.

186
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,800
Senior Jing,

187
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,840
you and I have both served three emperors.

188
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:09,499
You should also understand

189
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,410
that replacing the emperor is not as difficult as what common people think.

190
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,649
And it's not as predictable as what the emperor thinks.

191
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,669
Those inauspicious signs

192
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:25,169
are all made up by the Imperial Astronomers to make a living.

193
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,220
Senior Jing,

194
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,869
you and I know clearly why

195
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:36,110
the emperor let you handle this case instead of Commandery Prince An.

196
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,980
If Commandery Prince An handles this case,

197
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,839
with his personality, he would definitely make a thorough investigation.

198
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,639
That's pulling out the radish with the mud.

199
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,409
I'm afraid in the end,

200
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,080
most officials in the court couldn't get away from it.

201
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,079
His Majesty ordered you to handle this case,

202
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,469
you should know the best

203
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,620
what kind of result he wants. Right?

204
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,249
What His Majesty wants is to enforce the law impartially

205
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,300
and let the truth come to light.

206
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,270
Enforce the law impartially?

207
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:19,149
Qin Luan, the reason the Jing family has gone so far

208
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,619
is because we remain true to our original aspiration.

209
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,229
We always stay alert,

210
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,839
learn lessons from our mistakes,

211
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,670
and correct our mistakes.

212
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,370
Jing Zhi, look at you.

213
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,160
You're too old to

214
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,960
believe in such naive nonsense.

215
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,180
Qin Luan, I'm giving you a chance.

216
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,460
A chance?

217
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,279
I entered the palace at the age of seven.

218
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,560
Now I'm the acting chief eunuch.

219
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,150
It's not because of any chance given by other people.

220
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,290
It's my fate.

221
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,729
Look. I have a hold on politics in the Division of Eunuchs.

222
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,359
I have a hold on military power in the Shence Army.

223
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,029
I participate in national affairs and share the military and political power.

224
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,559
The emperor is nothing but a man who is surviving in the palace temporarily.

225
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,119
Even the common people know that emperors come and go in Tang,

226
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,620
but the Division of Eunuchs is always there.

227
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,939
The Division of Eunuchs is my chance.

228
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:28,730
What kind of chance are you talking about?

229
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,630
Eunuch Qin,

230
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,940
do you think you still have a way out?

231
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,819
In your situation,

232
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,300
only confessing everything might get you decently buried

233
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:49,620
considering that you have served His Majesty for years.

234
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:01,260
I can even add the beard on you.

235
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,510
I don't need you to serve me.

236
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,070
Thank you.

237
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,199
Senior Jing,

238
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,660
winner takes all.

239
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,670
My time hasn't run out yet.

240
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,949
Take him in.

241
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:36,550
Yes, Sir!

242
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,170
Get in.

243
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,330
♪ Shence Army marched westward ♪

244
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,600
Your Highness, how is it going?

245
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,609
He has been paying attention to the time and counting the hours.

246
00:18:58,609 --> 00:18:59,980
We guessed it right.

247
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,939
He has been prepared before leaving the palace.

248
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,969
If he doesn't go back to the palace at the agreed time,

249
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,679
his men in the palace will take action.

250
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,320
Now he is just stalling it.

251
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,630
What does he want to do?

252
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,630
To kill the emperor and usurp the throne.

253
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,860
Senior Jing, have you learned the Senza Misura

254
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,210
I taught you in the Royal Garden last time?

255
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,910
How was my singing just now?

256
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,740
Qin Luan, think it through.

257
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,890
Whether to be abandoned in the wilderness

258
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,109
or buried decently,

259
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:06,410
it's up to you.

260
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,489
I mean, Senior Jing.

261
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,489
Thank you for your kindness.

262
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,200
You'd better save your saliva and stay healthy.

263
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,440
Hold on!

264
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,600
Go ahead.

265
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,560
You are thoughtful indeed.

266
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,150
Father! Something happened!

267
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,630
- What is it?
- His Majesty...

268
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,210
His Majesty...

269
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,630
What?

270
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,079
Qin Luan, you...

271
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,640
How dare you kill the emperor!

272
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,010
Get... Get off me...

273
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:47,489
Senior Jing, don't be too sad.

274
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,159
His Majesty loves Huzhou Zisun the most.

275
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,689
He must have a cup of it at 7:00 p.m.

276
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:57,269
I think I've done my best to serve him

277
00:21:57,269 --> 00:22:01,480
by letting him die from his favorite tea.

278
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,130
Get off me.

279
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,260
Huzhou Zisun.

280
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,930
It's a waste of good tea.

281
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:25,760
Senior Jing, don't be too sad.

282
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:52,610
Eunuch Qin, are you laughing at Senior Jing?

283
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,170
Commandery Prince An.

284
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:17,600
You must have seen through the trick of the water clock, right?

285
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,830
That's right, Commandery Prince An.

286
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,230
Senior Jing is an old sly fox indeed.

287
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,040
He brought a faster water clock on purpose.

288
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,309
Look. He even covered up all the windows

289
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,340
to prevent me from seeing the changes in light and shadow outside.

290
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,689
Didn't he just want to

291
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,329
mess up my sense of time?

292
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:51,250
Then he played a show in front of me

293
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,450
to make me blurt out the truth

294
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,470
when I got carried away.

295
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,900
It's a pity

296
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:05,829
that Senior Jing never served in the palace.

297
00:24:05,829 --> 00:24:08,500
He would never know

298
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,189
that someone like me who has been serving His Majesty

299
00:24:11,189 --> 00:24:14,850
for most of my life

300
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:22,820
already has an accurate water clock in my heart.

301
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:31,290
That clock can't be disturbed by any means.

302
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:36,810
No.

303
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,960
Senior Jing thought about it.

304
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,420
He thought about it?

305
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,260
It was my idea to bring an inaccurate water clock.

306
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,020
But Senior Jing reminded me

307
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,849
that those who have been serving in the palace for a long time

308
00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:51,910
are extremely sensitive to time.

309
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:56,769
It's very hard to change your perception of time in a short time.

310
00:24:56,769 --> 00:24:59,810
So I decided to go with it.

311
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,830
What do you mean by that?

312
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,180
You think you know Senior Jing is acting.

313
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,220
In fact, Senior Jing also knows that you are acting.

314
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,060
You know that Senior Jing is good at recognizing lies,

315
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,669
so you must've told the truth when you said that the emperor would die of drinking the tea.

316
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:19,830
Only in this way can you fool Senior Jing.

317
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:24,130
But it's not what it means when you first heard it.

318
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:31,340
Looks like it's not the tea leaves that will kill the emperor.

319
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,189
It's not the water for making the tea.

320
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,900
But the cup for holding the tea.

321
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,560
Commandery Prince An.

322
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,420
With his look,

323
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,779
we can be sure that your inference is right.

324
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:56,300
Senior Jing, please take care of His Majesty.

325
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:01,920
Qin Luan, you are seeking your own death.

326
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:27,049
Commandery Prince An, even if you know it,

327
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:29,099
it's still too late.

328
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:33,500
Look. From the prison of the Court of Judicial Review to the palace,

329
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,059
it takes 30 minutes to get there riding a fast horse.

330
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:39,559
When the time is up, all the gates will be closed.

331
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:43,970
Even if you muster the soldiers outside and rush into the palace,

332
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,850
the palace will be bleeding at that time.

333
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,279
Then the young master will ascend throne,

334
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:55,660
and the Daming Palace is still mine.

335
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:01,310
Xiao Jinyu, what else can you do?

336
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,750
You are extremely sensitive to time,

337
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,900
but your perception of direction is no different from that of ordinary people.

338
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,100
We had too little time to prepare for the interrogation today.

339
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,590
After some thinking, I bet on two things.

340
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,460
Tell me about it.

341
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,359
First, I bet you don't go out of the palace very often.

342
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:28,329
You are unfamiliar with the way from the Imperial Medical Service

343
00:27:28,329 --> 00:27:31,360
to the prison of the Court of Judicial Review.

344
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,250
Second, I bet that you are not familiar with

345
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:37,370
the interrogation room of the prison of the Court of Judicial Review.

346
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,820
What is this place?

347
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,520
This is the Yeting Prison in the palace.

348
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,919
From here to Jiangshan Hall,

349
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,700
it takes less than 7.5 minutes with Jing Yi's speed.

350
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,950
[Token]

351
00:28:02,951 --> 00:28:06,739
Qin Luan announced false imperial edicts and rose in rebellion!

352
00:28:06,739 --> 00:28:08,139
He committed an unforgivable sin!

353
00:28:08,139 --> 00:28:09,859
If you don't throw down your weapons and surrender now,

354
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:12,860
you will be executed now and have three generations of familial exterminations!

355
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,429
Qin Luan, do you think you can

356
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,950
sack the Daming Palace by closing the gates?

357
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,330
Xiao Jinyu.

358
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:28,070
I've lived an illustrious life.

359
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:33,510
I didn't expect to lose to a young man.

360
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,850
I won't accept this.

361
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:13,429
It's a pity that the white jade teacup from my brother can't be used anymore.

362
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,430
Deal with it.

363
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:20,019
Maybe it's my brother who protected me again.

364
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:22,360
Yes. Rest assured, Your Majesty.

365
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,379
Everything is going well as per Commandery Prince An's plan.

366
00:29:25,379 --> 00:29:29,329
Qin Luan's people in the Forbidden Armies have all been arrested.

367
00:29:29,329 --> 00:29:32,630
I really didn't expect that Qin Luan could be so bold

368
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:37,079
that he even tried to kill you as Commandery Prince An expected.

369
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,919
Qin Luan has a hold on military power.

370
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,160
He has been scourging Tang for a long time.

371
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,589
The accumulated abuses are hard to eliminate.

372
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,000
Even if I'm sitting on the throne,

373
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,800
I have to use such a way to deal with them.

374
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,000
It has been hard for you

375
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,030
to take risks for me during such a long time.

376
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,090
Jinbao, keep a close eye on him.

377
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,820
Yes.

378
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,939
I have found out that Rugui House keeps many killers.

379
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:09,110
The instructor behind the manager...

380
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,079
Eunuch Sun, I haven't thanked you for letting me stay.

381
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,970
Look at you.

382
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,470
Sun Mingde!

383
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,909
Rest assured and stay by my side.

384
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:22,020
I won't treat you badly.

385
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,020
Thank you, Your Majesty.

386
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:28,239
I'm willing to go through fire and water for Your Majesty and never shrink from dangers.

387
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,799
Zhou Han went missing just after Qin Luan was taken into prison today.

388
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,500
There is also a group of people missing from the Shence Army.

389
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,399
I guess they fled with Zhou Han.

390
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:42,880
Zhou Han is lustful, greedy for money,

391
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,800
and simple minded.

392
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,650
Now Qin Luan is dead.

393
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:51,629
The only chance for him to regain wealth is to turn to Xue Rucheng.

394
00:30:51,629 --> 00:30:53,809
Xue Rucheng is also in urgent need of people.

395
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:58,639
Not to mention someone like Zhou Han who knows everything about Chang'an.

396
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Then I'll send more people to arrest him as soon as possible.

397
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,959
No hurry.

398
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,810
Let him go. He is useful for us.

399
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,880
The tyrant is ruthless and immoral.

400
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,840
When he just took the throne,

401
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,809
he ordered his soldiers to disguise themselves as bandits

402
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:17,710
and slaughter more than a hundred innocent people in my mansion

403
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,179
just out of fear.

404
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,200
But God bless Tang to let me survive till this day

405
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,630
and have a chance to kill the tyrant in person.

406
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,499
I promised before that one day

407
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,530
I would lead you to avenge your families.

408
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:36,780
This day is coming.

409
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,859
Avenge!

410
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:44,549
Avenge! Avenge! Avenge!

411
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:46,959
Your Highness! Right now, we are outnumbered.

412
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,929
We lost Qin Luan's help.

413
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,629
Our people can't hide among the examinees.

414
00:31:51,629 --> 00:31:54,630
It's not a good time for revenge now.

415
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,400
Shen Yu,

416
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,260
you've just become the Capital Liaison Representative

417
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:05,160
and taken salary from the Li family for a few days.

418
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,689
Now you have forgottenhow your father died.

419
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,309
Uncle Chi, you know that is not what I meant.

420
00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:12,019
What do you mean then?

421
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,420
I...

422
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,949
I just think Xiao Jinyu is pressing hard.

423
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,910
The situation is against us.

424
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,210
I think we should

425
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:25,790
take a break and recover ourselves, waiting for a better chance.

426
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,090
Well...

427
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,630
Your Highness.

428
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,510
Not many of you experienced the tragedy of that year.

429
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,919
I understand that you cringe now.

430
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,529
But I believe if those who died tragically in my mansion

431
00:32:48,529 --> 00:32:53,529
were lucky enough to survive, they would join me

432
00:32:53,529 --> 00:32:56,619
to kill the tyrant and fight to the last moment

433
00:32:56,619 --> 00:32:59,580
to defend the rightful emperor of Tang.

434
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:03,679
Now an ignorant young man is playing the saboteur.

435
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,210
If I withdraw now,

436
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:09,229
how can I deserve to be the descendant of the Li clan?

437
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:14,089
How should I face my parents in Heaven?

438
00:33:14,089 --> 00:33:17,559
How should I face those hundreds of innocent people

439
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:20,610
who died tragically in Qianzhou?

440
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:23,429
I swear allegiance to Your Highness!

441
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:26,580
I swear allegiance to Your Highness!

442
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,200
You guessed it right again.

443
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,760
Li Zhang's mother was an embroiderer in Duke Chang's mansion.

444
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,920
Zhao Jie's father and brother were guards in Duke Chang's mansion.

445
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,220
Wu Chen's eldest sister was a chef in Duke Chang's mansion.

446
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,560
And also, the dancer who killed Yan Ming,

447
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,429
her mother in Chang'an was not her biological mother.

448
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,819
Her biological mother was also a servant in Duke Chang'an mansion.

449
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,130
When the bandits ransacked the mansion,

450
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,210
their families in there were all killed.

451
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:59,060
I guess Xue Rucheng made use of it

452
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,890
to muster them to work for him.

453
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,100
Guess which doctor treated Duke Chang

454
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:08,800
when he left the palace because of smallpox?

455
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,290
Zhang Shu?

456
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,610
Lord Jing, you're back.

457
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,440
Are you eating?

458
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,649
I just made some snacks for His Highness.

459
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,450
Have some too.

460
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,799
Now we've taken down Qin Luan.

461
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,070
Xue Rucheng lost his greatest help.

462
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,519
My father cared for the examinees

463
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,700
and his proposal of providing food and housing was approved by His Majesty.

464
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:43,009
In this way, the rebels of Xue Rucheng

465
00:34:43,009 --> 00:34:46,059
among the examinees won't live there to make sure they can act freely.

466
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:49,620
Then we can roughly infer the number of rebels according to

467
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,559
the number of examinees in Qianzhou who sign up for the accommodations.

468
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:57,000
But are those examinees willing to be kept together?

469
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,279
They can save money on food and accommodations.

470
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,039
It's convenient to make friends and expand contacts.

471
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,780
They should be happy about it.

472
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:06,510
But... without Qin Luan's help,

473
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:09,059
if the number of rebels is exposed,

474
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,760
will Xue Rucheng flee out of fear?

475
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,870
That would be troublesome then.

476
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,920
He won't.

477
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,229
He has been planning for years.

478
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:21,819
Now, he is only one step away from the throne.

479
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:26,619
There is no way he can go back to the old days when he hid himself and bided his time.

480
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:28,960
Even to pull chestnuts out of the fire,

481
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,220
he will take the risk and do it.

482
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:34,330
Without Qin Luan's help in the palace,

483
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,480
he has to figure out a way outside the palace.

484
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,910
With limited men and no source of news about the emperor,

485
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:44,110
he can't take actions

486
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,459
in the heavily guarded banquets or the royal sacrifices.

487
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:51,470
His only chance is a small event

488
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:55,719
that can gather the royal family and the officials.

489
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,690
What could it be?

490
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:02,429
It should be out of his expectation that Qin Luan lost his power.

491
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,820
Instead of letting him look for a chance,

492
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,820
we might as well offer him one.

493
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,200
Offer him one?

494
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,950
To draw him out?

495
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,730
I got it.

496
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:19,410
I read it from the Prince Consort's story

497
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,300
that scholars from various places will gather in Chang'an during the Imperial Examination.

498
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:26,919
The court will also hold some poetry parties and tea parties.

499
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:28,999
The emperor and ministers would also attend it.

500
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,500
Are you talking about that?

501
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,389
It's definitely not what His Highness is talking about.

502
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,890
Why?

503
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:38,540
That is exactly the problem.

504
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,199
His Highness means that we need to arrest the rebels.

505
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,000
But we can't make a lot of noise about Duke Chang.

506
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,920
For the people,

507
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,359
Xue Rucheng has been burned to death.

508
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,149
Duke Chang has also been dead for years.

509
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:54,359
These rumors were just spread by some bored people.

510
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:58,359
So we'd better wipe them out as quietly as we can.

511
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:00,840
I still don't understand it.

512
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,230
Because once we make any waves,

513
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:08,270
whether he succeeds or fails,

514
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,670
those who harbor ill intentions

515
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:14,259
in the neighboring regions and countries might make a big deal out of it.

516
00:37:14,259 --> 00:37:18,390
Then the state will be in chaos

517
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:21,289
and the innocent people will suffer.

518
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,570
What should we do then?

519
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:27,330
Let me think about it.

00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:19,509
♫  I’m still young, with my love not yet realized for you, but I'm
willing to be here for you till the end

532
00:39:19,509 --> 00:39:26,479
♫  You can rely on me in this lifetime  ♫

533
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:34,870
♫  Hope to spend this beautiful lifetime together  ♫
