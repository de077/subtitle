00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,900
I misunderstood His Highness.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,559
He checked on my family background

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,290
because he wanted me to work for him.

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,280
And I finally learned who my mother was.

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,919
Fate is such a fantastic thing.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,309
I never expected to meet such a good man like His Highness

9
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,790
Life had mercy on me

10
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,470
so that I managed to meet her.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,099
Did His Majesty dream that

12
00:00:43,099 --> 00:00:46,419
the late emperor's son Duke Chang came back to life

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,370
and would take back the throne?

14
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,999
Don't talk nonsense.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,610
Go. Go get some tea.

16
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,549
I'm the lineal son of Emperor Wuzong.

17
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,960
You're simply my father's uncle.

18
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,760
If you hadn't pretended to be insane and let the eunuchs kill my family,

19
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,310
you wouldn't have taken the throne.

20
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:42,500
I'm doomed to be the emperor.

I'm here.

34
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:01,470
There are rumors in the palace about the late emperor's son, Duke Chang.

35
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,900
Have you heard about them?

36
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:11,089
Your Majesty, as you said, they're mere rumors.

37
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:13,419
Ignorant men are wrongly informed.

38
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,089
Don't bother to trust them.

39
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,240
Ignorant men?

40
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,319
Censors reported to me about it.

41
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,259
Are my censors also ignorant men?

42
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:29,879
All sons of the late emperor died.

43
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,470
It's been recorded in the genealogy.

44
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,659
Nothing will go wrong.

45
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,810
It's ridiculous to say that Duke Chang is still alive.

46
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:46,000
If it becomes a serious problem, our state may be harmed.

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,809
Nothing comes out of nothing.

48
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,980
Who would make an issue of a long-gone duke?

49
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,779
- Qin Luan.
- I'm here.
- You served three emperors.

50
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,859
I make you the Acting Chief Eunuch because I believe that

51
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,160
you can take care of everything in the palace.

52
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,940
When I assign you to figure out where such rumors came from

53
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,550
and who started them, this isn't a tough job. Is it?

54
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:21,020

[Guanling Yamen]

56
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,780
General Xiao, I was on my way to see you.

57
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,500
Lend me some soldiers.

58
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,300
It's getting dark. Why do you want them?

59
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,599
His Highness hides a dead man in the Chu family. He wants to bring the body here.

60
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:48,430
Why are you in official costume? Were you recognized?

61
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,579
What? Li Zhang went back to his mansion.

62
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,970
Let's talk about it later. Lend me some soldiers first.

63
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,530
How can you do it secretly like this?

64
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,490
Doing it secretly means not letting people know about the dead man,

65
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,280
instead of seeing me.

66
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,379
You were with His Highness last night.

67
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:06,899
Do you know who the dead man is?

68
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:09,839
Well, it's hard to explain.

69
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,739
Ask him yourself.

70
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,440
Then, what are you coming for?

71
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,809
To get some medicine for Jinyu and see how it is going with you.

72
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:19,240
We must get Jinyu to live at the Yamen as soon as possible.

73
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,699
He should no longer live in Chu Chu's home.

74
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,300
Why?

75
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,790
It's hard to explain.

76
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:30,070
Leng Yue told me that Chu Chu annoyed His Highness.

77
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,029
It's...

78
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:34,820
Hard to explain again?

79
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,809
Yes.

80
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:42,279
I simply left His Highness for one day and so many things happened?

81
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,060

82
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,960

84
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,320
- My Lord.
- Is Miss Chu Chu in?

85
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,140
- Yes.
- Yes.

86
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,850

87
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,969

You may rise.

91
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,069
What do you come for?

92
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:35,059
I want to borrow something from the Chu family, for some business.

93
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,929
What business?

94
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,549
General Xiao's subordinates captured a bandit.

95
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,629
Unexpectedly, they fought hard and accidentally killed him.

96
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,509
We need to take his corpse back for inspection,

97
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,739
but we might ruin him on the slippery road after the rain.

98
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,189
I hear that the Chu family sells coffins.

99
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,810
I'd like to buy one.

100
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,659
May I?

101
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:55,869
Yes. Yes.

102
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,399
We have coffins available. Let me take him there.

103
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,690
Please stay, Sir.

104
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,679
Let Chu Chu take them there.

105
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,309
No matter which one they pick, I'll pay according to the fixed price.

106
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,890
Don't bother paying.

107
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,100
We're coroners.

108
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,469
It's our duty to work for officials.

109
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,440
It's generous of you, Sir.

110
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,149
Chu Chu, let's go back to the Yamen with Jing Yi

111
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,009
and take care of the bandit thing.

112
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:19,510
Yes.

113
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,089
I'm sorry!

I'm sorry, Your Highness!

115

121
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,590
I didn't say anything.

00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:25,244
Thank you, Your Highness.

127
00:08:25,244 --> 00:08:28,280
Your Highness, the coffin...?

128
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,429
Well, it's a bandit General Xiao's subordinate killed.

129
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,439
We brought the corpse back in a coffin from the Chu family.

130
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,809
Ask no questions about this issue.

131
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:39,310
I'll have it handled.

132
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,889
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,609
I had weak governance in Guanling County,

134
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:45,319
so that you were disturbed by bandits.

135
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,180
Please punish me.

136
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,780
It takes a long time to annihilate bandits.

137
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,869
Just work hard on it.

138

153

Find out the household register of the Xu family.

154
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,879
The Xu family?

155
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,259
It was a big family that moved away years ago.

156
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:57,469
Your Highness, do you mean the Xu family where Deputy Magistrate Tan lived?

157
00:09:57,469 --> 00:10:01,119
Deputy Magistrate lived there?

158
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,679
Your Highness, his father, Tan Hong, was the butler

working for the Xu family.

160
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,980
After they moved away, the Tan family lived in the old mansion

161
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,149
to take care of it.

162
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,189

Why is there only the record of Xu Zongfang and his wife?

169
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,909
What about his ancestors?

170
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,369
Does he have siblings?

I'm not too lazy to make records.

Before I took up my post, the archive had a fire.

176

Nearly all files were burned.

177
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,149
I made up all the files you're reading.

178

There're some omissions, without a doubt.

Do you remember when the fire occurred?

182
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,869
I don't know. I was on my way to this county.

183
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:29,349
I simply knew that the previous magistrate left.

184
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:35,200
I guess the fire happened after he left and before I came.

185
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,709
I see.

186
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,199
Thank you.

187
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,500
You're welcome, Your Highness.

188
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,690
Get back to your business.

189
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,380
Yes.

190
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,500
Isn't she Chu Chu?

191
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,440
Why is she staying with His Highness?

192
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,199
[Archive]

193
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,880
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

194
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,990
Your Highness, are we going to the Xu family and ask Butler Tan?

195
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,735
It's not time to go yet.

196
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:28,230
Who else can we ask, then?

197
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,930
Deputy Magistrate Tan?

198
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,439
I want to ask someone before the Tan family.

199
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,719
But I need your permission.

200
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,630
I permit. Go wherever you want.

201
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,740
I permit.

202
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,170
I don't mean going somewhere.

203
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,460
I mean seeing someone with your permission.

204
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,830
Who?

205
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,960
Your mother, Lady Xu.

206
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,779
You... what do you mean?

207
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,200
Open her coffin.

208
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,539
The fire in the archive is quite odd.

209
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,979
It happened between the shifts of two magistrates,

210
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,200
also after the Xu family moved away.

211
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,340
It may have something to do with them.

212
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:17,899
Your Highness, do you suspect my mother didn't kill herself?

213
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,729
I don't know yet.

214
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,080
So, we shouldn't visit the Xu Mansion first.

215
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,630
In the coffin are your mother's remains and corpse.

216
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,729
Tan Hong may lie.

217
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,910
But your mother will not, right?

218
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,530
I agree.

219
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,310
But, Your Highness,

220
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,019
may I inspect my mother's corpse?

221
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:43,540
I assure you that I'll inspect her corpse as I do to other bodies.

222
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,280
All right. You can do that.

223
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,979
Thank you, Your Highness.

224
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:53,340
Tomorrow, I'll ask my men to prepare some necessary things.

225
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,440
You can get ready, too.

226
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,019
Brother, where have you been?

227
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:07,240
You didn't come back for dinner.

228
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,510
Did you have it out there?

229
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:12,190
Yes. I had dinner with Jing Yi in the Yamen.

230
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,150
Magistrate Zheng is quite clingy.

231
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,560
I know you like to be quiet.

232
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,490
I didn't invite you, then.

233
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,929
Did Chu He tell you something?

234
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:24,230
Chu He?

235
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,030
No.

236
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,080
What would he tell me?

237
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,350
He...

238
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,680
It's hard to explain.

239
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,540
I'll tell you later.

240
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,170
What?

241
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,489
I'm used to a casual life in the army. But you love to be clean.

242
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:06,199
If I don't have a bath, I'm afraid you can't fall asleep.

243
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,690
Brother, don't feel restrained by me.

244
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,851
I don't. I feel comfortable as long as you do.

245
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:12,680
Go to sleep. I'll be back after a bath.

246
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,729
All right.

247
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,879
Brother, may I use some of your soldiers tomorrow?

248
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:19,000
Sure. What for?

249
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,080
You'll know tomorrow.

250
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,320
Jinyu, did you ask Leng Yue to keep an eye on Jing Yi?

251
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,759
Leng Yue's keeping an eye on Jing Yi?

252
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,959
Yeah. Before I came back,

253
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:33,129
I saw Leng Yue peeking furtively outside Jing Yi's room.

254
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:36,219
I thought you asked her to do that, so I didn't stop her.

255
00:15:36,219 --> 00:15:39,010
What are they up to?

256
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,620
What? You didn't ask her to do that?

257
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,680
Then, why did she peek at Jing Yi?

258
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,200
I guess Leng Yue came with me, under my mother's order.

259
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,169
I think Mother is vigilant about Chu Chu

260
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,879
and she asked Leng Yue to keep an eye on her

261
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,100
because Leng Yue is also a girl.

262
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,589
Leng Yue was with Chu Chu all the way here

263
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:04,150
and never let Chu Chu stay out of sight.

264
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,920
Now, she's keeping an eye on Jing Yi, instead of Chu Chu.

265
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,220
She possibly does it, because of Chu Chu, too.

266
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,610
Leng Yue...

267
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,320
But it looks like Miss Chu has nothing to do

268
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,490
with the Jing family.

269
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,240
Vice Minister Jing.

270
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,100
Greetings, Vice Minister Jing.

271
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,690
Deputy Magistrate Tan, it's you?

272
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:04,629
When I was at the capital for the civil exam, Senior Jing helped me.

273
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,110
I'd like to work for your family.

274
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:17,010
Send the two drawings back to the capital.

275
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,620
Rest assured.

276
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,820
I'll have them sent as soon as possible.

277
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,350
Jing Yi.

278
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,270
Jing Yi!

279
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,630
Why are you here?

280
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,190
Why are you in such a desolate place in the middle of the night?

281
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,990
I saw a man behaving furtively at the gate of the Yamen.

282
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,330
Then I followed him.

283
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,000
But he was gone when he came here.

284
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,560
Did you see someone when you came?

285
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,160
No.

286
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,079
You really followed someone here?

287
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,980
What else?

288
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,629
I thought you came out in the middle of the night to flirt with some girl.

289
00:18:01,629 --> 00:18:05,789
It's such a desolate place. What girl can I flirt with?

290
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:06,959
What did you say?

291
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,050
Nothing.

292
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:13,490
I mean I shouldn't flirt with any girl.

293
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,069
All right. It's too late.

294
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,870
Let's get back to sleep.

295
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,239
General Xiao! Your Highness!

296
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,410
Anything unusual?

297
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,869
General Xiao, nothing is unusual.

298
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,360
Only nearby people have come to have a look.

299
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,590
As ordered, we told them that

300
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,719
the mansion's wall collapsed because it had been in long disrepair, and we guarded this place in case people got hurt.

301
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,320
Good job.

302
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,170
Last time, we didn't check carefully in the middle of the night.

303
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:11,239
Now that Father left this place willingly and left a corpse,

304
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:14,269
there must be something else in this room.

305
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,579
You wanted to borrow soldiers to search this room?

306
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,080
No.

307
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,169
You mustn't come in!

308
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,979
Let me in. I come to see His Highness!

309
00:19:27,979 --> 00:19:30,479
General Xiao ordered that no one could come in

310
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,890
without permission from him or His Highness.

311
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,590
Let her in.

312
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,950
Let her in!

313
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,550
Yes!

314
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,330
What's the rush? What happened?

315
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,489
Nothing. Nothing.

316
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,030
When I woke up this morning, I didn't see you.

317
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,090
I... I thought...

318
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,609
You thought I broke my promise and took another coroner to open the coffin instead of you?

319
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,289
Your Highness, it's not that I don't trust you.

320
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,290
I just... I just...

321
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,790
I'm sorry.

322
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,680
What coffin?

323
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,340
Everything's still in preparation.

324
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,379
Brother, you'll know later.

325
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,750
Are you looking for Sir Witch Doctor?

326
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,649
Has the room remained the same since he left?

327
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,880
Yes.

328
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,390
So, Sir Witch Doctor never planned to come back again.

329
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,800
No matter where he has gone, I will find him.

330
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,129
What will we do now?

331
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,189
Look around for some clues.

332
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:39,039
Chu Chu. Brother. Don't take it as a job.

333
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,809
Based on how much you know him, look for anything

334
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:46,930
that may be related to him or about his whereabouts.

335
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,000
Brother.

336
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,600
What's this?

337
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,191
It's... Chess!

338
00:21:26,191 --> 00:21:27,580
Chess?

339
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,780
Baoying Chess.

340
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,420
It was quite popular in the Northern Zhou Dynasty.

341
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,289
You can call it Chess.

342
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,509
Chess?

343
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,110
[Elephant]

344
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:38,360
Chu Chu, have you seen this before?

345
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,539
I saw Sir Witch Doctor polishing the stones.

346
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:44,009
But there weren't any characters on the stones.

347
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,929
Did he teach you to play chess?

348
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,730
No.

349
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,990
Brother, when you searched the room,

350
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,620
did you see anything like a chessboard?

351
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,120
No.

352
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,900
Brother.

353
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,180
Here it is!

354
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,399
It's flexible.

355
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:23,500
Let me try.

356
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,900
[Chess book]

357
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,359
It's... It's like an end-game.

358
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,340
Brother, let's try it.

359
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:48,980
[End-game]

360
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:57,480
I simply asked for one-day sick leave, but you caught me at home.

361
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,590
If it weren't for complicated business in the Ministry of War

362
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:04,009
and I not knowing what to do, I wouldn't dare to come and disturb you.

363
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,760
When you first worked in the Ministry of War,

364
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,540
you got bullied with reason.

365
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:13,020
When you wanted to apply strict measures, they also wanted to deflate you.

366
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,709
You're Commandery Prince An's teacher and my disciple.

367
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:20,690
It makes sense when they fear you.

368
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:26,119
Speaking of Commandery Prince An, since he gave me the copper coin,

369
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,379
he hasn't contacted me again.

370
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,200
I'm really worried.

371
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,930
But I don't dare to send him a letter, without consideration.

372
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,699
I win.

373
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,110
What... What does it mean?

374
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,390
I don't understand, either.

375
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:51,230
Is there any clue?

376
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,150
Well, I'll try again with the white chessman.

377
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,650
All right.

378
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,739
Commandery Prince An is always considerate.

379
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,460
When there's no news, it means good news.

380
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:13,659
At the court, no one is better than him in solving criminal cases.

381
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:18,300
He'll solve the illegal coin case sooner or later.

382
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:29,110
I worry that he hasn't reported this case yet.

383
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:35,130
Considering his temper, I'm afraid he'll make trouble.

384
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,240
I win.

385
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,900
I've never improved my skill in playing chess.

386
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,469
Sorry, Sir.

387
00:24:48,469 --> 00:24:50,499
You don't have poor skills.

388
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,470
You simply worry too much.

389
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,390
You should give up unnecessary concerns.

390
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:59,169
Or when you're lost in worries, you'll lose more than gain.

391
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,820
I'll keep that in mind, Sir.

392
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,839
It's getting late.

393
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,780
I'll leave you alone.

394
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,199
It's a draw.

395
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:34,580
No one wins or loses?

396
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,860
Yes.

397
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,800
Jinyu, what does it mean?

398
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,640
[Rook]

399
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,160
[Knight]

400
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,459
[Elephant]

401
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,579
[Pawn]

402
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,100
[Rook | Knight | Elephant | Pawn]

403
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,560
What are you doing?

404
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,900
When the last game ended,

405
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,460
these four chessmen were in the same four squares.

406
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,810
What have you got?

407
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:09,310
Father wouldn't take the trouble to leave a useless end-game without a reason.

408
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:12,359
There must be some secret I haven't figured out yet.

409
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,840
Your Highness, everything's ready on the mountain.

410
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,420
[Xu's Tomb]

411
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:41,730
The ninth day of the first month, the first year of Emperor Wenzong.

412
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,629
Father, am I correct?

413
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,860
Yes. You're right.

414
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,719
The ninth day of the first month is my birthday.

415
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,230
Is it her birthday, too?

416
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:56,789
No, it's not her birthday.

417
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:59,379
It was the day she died.

418
00:26:59,379 --> 00:27:04,200
She died on the day you were born.

419
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,130
It's your fate.

420
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:08,300
Fate?

421
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,900
It...

422
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:17,230
It means she's different to you from others.

423
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,990
Come on, Chu Chu. Kneel.

424
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,190
Burn it for her.

425
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:28,030
Tell her that today is your birthday
[Xu's Tomb]

426
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,400
and you're happy.
[Xu's Tomb]

427
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,440
Today's my birthday.

428
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,779
Grandfather bought me a new dress.

429
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,009
Brother wove a little rabbit for me.

430
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,419
I'm so happy today.

431
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,629
Father, is it all right?

432
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,630
Very good.

433
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:55,280
Mother, I've come to worship you since I was little.

434
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,010
But this is the first time I've come as your daughter.

435
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:03,649
I'm sorry, Mother, for I have to disturb you.

436
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:07,769
I want to know who you are, who my father is,

437
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:11,760
if you suffered injustice,

438
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,239
and if you were wronged.

439
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,789
These things matter a lot to me.

440
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,130
I hope you can understand.

441
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,010
Mother, don't worry.

442
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,730
Commandery Prince An is the best judge in this world.

443
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,530
I work for him.

444
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:33,070
As long as we inspect your corpse, we'll know

445
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,360
what you want to tell us.

446
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,570
Mother,

447
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:46,480
please bless me for everything if you see it in Heaven.

448
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,380
Your Highness, open the coffin.

449
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,280
Did we really ask Miss Chu to inspect her mother's corpse?

450
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,629
Don't worry.

451
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:50,750
No matter what you do, your mother won't blame you.

452
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,429
On the death anniversary of Prince Consort,

453
00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:21,340
you visited Her Grace for His Majesty.
[Jiangshan Hall]

454
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,680
Was everything all right?

455
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,369
Fortunately, I arrived in time.

456
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:29,199
Otherwise, Her Grace would have been annoyed by Qin Luan again.

457
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,799
I forgot to ask you.

458
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,910
You have never gone in this hall, have you?
[Jiangshan Hall]

459
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:36,630
No. I simply replied before the screen.

460
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:41,149
Everything in this hall concerns the safety of our nation.

461
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,839
No one can enter, but confidential officials.

462
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,029
You're now the Minister of War.

463
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,000
You can certainly enter the hall.

464
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,859
You no longer need to reply before the screen.

465
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,100
[Jiangshan Hall]

466
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,499
Your Majesty, Military Commissioner of Qianzhongdao garrisons

467
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:07,889
is an important fastness in the Southwest.

468
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,659
But Leng Peishan is quite old.

469
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,619
A successor should be picked as soon as possible.

470
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,389
Xiao Jinli is the son of a national hero

471
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:15,999
and he's the son of Princess Xiping.

472
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,770
He can be the best candidate.

473
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:24,100
Xue, you're now the Minister of War.

474
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,100
What do you think?

475
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:34,800
Your Majesty, I think Senior Jing makes sense.

476
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,930
You also recommend Xiao Jinli?

477
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,430
Yes.

478
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,710
Look at you.

479
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:55,509
You're known for being detached and not seeking fame.

480
00:31:55,509 --> 00:31:59,089
Unexpectedly, shortly after you become the Minister of War,

481
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:01,129
you begin to gang up on me?

482
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:02,319
Please understand, Your Majesty.

483
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:04,479
I don't dare to gang up on you.

484
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,720
Then, what do you mean?

485
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,870
In the Army of Qianzhongdao, Xiao Jinli is never the best candidate

486
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:14,559
to take over Leng Peishan's post, in terms of qualification,

487
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,540
military exploit, or even rank.

488
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:21,389
Your Majesty, considering qualification, military exploit, or rank,

489
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:24,380
Xiao Jinli is never the best candidate.

490
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,029
But speaking of stabilizing the nation and winning people's support,

491
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,799
Xiao Jinli is the best choice.

492
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,959
Stabilizing the nation and winning people's support?

493
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,409
What do you mean?

494
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:38,529
Your Majesty, the Leng family has a deep foundation in the Southwest,

495
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,289
we can't underestimate their power.

496
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,769
Especially Leng Peishan.

497
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:44,129
He has tens of thousands of picked soldiers.

498
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,499
By annihilating bandits and helping the poor,

499
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,889
he's quite supported by local people.

500
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,889
So far, a great many people respond to his call.

501
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:56,769
Southwestern counties are far away from Chang'an.

502
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,970
If it goes like this,

503
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:03,379
I'm afraid he'll control the Southwest.

504
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,960
Your Majesty, Senior Jing means that

505
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,649
General Leng has been doing his duty, but he's getting old.

506
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,789
I understand what he means.

507
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:13,620
Yes.

508
00:33:13,621 --> 00:33:20,400
Jing, Xiao Jinli's mother Princess Xiping is Leng Peishan's niece.

509
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,000
If the Leng family wants to reign independently,

510
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,530
isn't promoting Xiao Jinli exactly what they want?

511
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,339
Think about it, Your Majesty.

512
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,189
That year, Emperor Wenzong married Leng Peishan's sister,

513
00:33:33,189 --> 00:33:36,719
simply to restrain the Leng family.

514
00:33:36,719 --> 00:33:39,359
Now, his sister is dead.

515
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:42,109
Princess Xiping is his only niece.

516
00:33:42,109 --> 00:33:44,109
She can barely restrain the Leng family.

517
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:47,719
But if Xiao Jinli can take the power of the Leng family,

518
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:49,319
things will be different.

519
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,829
Princess Xiping is his mother.

520
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:54,830
When his mother and brother are in Chang'an,

521
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,410
how can he act wildly?

522
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,130
You make sense.

523
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:03,909
But Leng Peishan will understand what we have planned.

524
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:07,659
I'm afraid he won't easily agree.

525
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:14,419
Your Majesty, I have a satisfactory plan, but it's not very frank.

526
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,600
What is it?

527
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,840
Leng Peishan is old and his single son died at a young age.

528
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,440
He has no family but his granddaughter Leng Yue.

529
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,010
She's nearly as old as Xiao Jinli.

530
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:26,450
They also grew up together.

531
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:30,650
If she marries Xiao Jinli, Leng Peishan will cultivate Xiao Jinli

532
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:32,370
with earnest efforts.

533
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:36,239
In this way, you can maintain your relationship with Leng Peishan

534
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,309
and remove the trouble in the Southwest without sending any troops.

535
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,119
It doesn't sound very frank.

536
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,589
But when it can protect people from war,

537
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:49,980
we must choose the lesser one of two evils.

538
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,800
I can't let them get married.

539
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,520
Senior Jing.

540
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,579
Senior Jing, the plan doesn't sound right.

541
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,229
It's right.

542
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,669
It's not a perfect plan.

543
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:11,499
But it's already good enough when no troops are needed.

544
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:16,129
But don't you always say that you're a close friend of Prince Consort

545
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:20,089
and you'll defend Princess Xiping and her sons, no matter what happens?

546
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:22,640
If General Leng really wants to reign the Southwest independently,

547
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,830
and he knows this, Commandery Prince An and General Xiao

548
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,880
will be in great danger.

549
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,270
What dangerous condition will Princess Xiping be in?

550
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,700
Have you thought about their safety?

551
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,330
Minister Xue, don't forget.

552
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,740
My son is with Commandery Prince An now.

553
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:42,300
He can't be safe unless His Highness is.

554
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:46,250
Only His Majesty, you, and I know this plan.

555
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,330
His Majesty and I won't let Leng Peishan know it

556
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:51,509
before it's time to strike.

557
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:56,430
As long as you keep it secret, they'll be safe.

558
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:59,360
Yes. I understand.

559
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,900
Your Highness, yesterday my father said

560
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,890
my mother hit the wall and died with obvious bruises on her forehead?

561
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:30,940
Yes.

562
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,070
But, Your Highness, when I checked her skull,

563
00:36:33,071 --> 00:36:35,330
there wasn't any bone fracture on her forehead.

564
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,639
Instead, there's a fracture on the back of her head.

565
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,410
There're ruddy bruises on both ends of the fracture.

566
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:43,799
So, she was hurt before she died and she was badly wounded.

567
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,319
When the back of her head was wounded, she would certainly die.

568
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,980
Do you mean she not only hurt her forehead when hitting the wall but also wounded the back of her head?

569
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:54,539
No. She didn't hit the wall.

570
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:58,970
She was hit by something blunt intensively.

571
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,830
You mean...?

572
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:11,000
Your Highness, my mother didn't kill herself, she was murdered!

573
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:27,970
