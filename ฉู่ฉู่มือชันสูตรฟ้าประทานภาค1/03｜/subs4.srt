2
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:11,380
The Prince sent people to save me and found my baggage for me.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,200
I've never seen such a good official like him.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,900
It would be great if I can work with him.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,939
The Prince must be the Handsome Judge.

6
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:25,770
Otherwise, how would he know so much about the Handsome Judge?

7
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,650
Miss, I think you better confess.

8
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,909
You have tasted the food in the jail.

9
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,689
Don't you want a quick death?

10
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:42,800
A life for a life.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,850
I have nothing to say.

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,389
I can't report to Commandery Prince An just with your life.

13
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:50,489
Let's talk about this.

14
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,149
I heard from Commandery Prince An that you killed Yan Ming to steal something.

15
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:55,459
You are a weak woman.

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,839
It's not easy for you to use great effort to steal something.

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,909
I'm not asking you to return it.

18
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,359
Just tell me what kind of stuff it is.

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,860
I'll give Commandery Prince An a similar one to finish my task.

20
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,600
It's a win-win solution.

21
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,899
Vice Minister Jing has a glib tongue indeed.

22
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:17,280
Since Prince An doesn't know what I stole, you can put him off

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,680
with anything you want.

24
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,079
Why bother?

25
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,110
You really stole something from Yan Ming?

26
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,970
I didn't believe Commandery Prince An when he told me about it.

27
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,060
Yan Ming is a nerd.

28
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,149
There are a few valuable paintings and calligraphy works in his manor.

29
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,369
But they are not worth enough to get him killed.

30
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:40,359
And you had no chance to take the thing out of

31
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,309
Yan Manor on the night when it happened.

32
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,679
I thought Commandery Prince An made a mistake.

33
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,419
Now it seems that I really have to give him something to finish my task.

34
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,270
To be frank,

35
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,750
I really want to put him off with something.

36
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,229
But who is Commandery Prince An?

37
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,680
He is Deity Erlang.
(T/N: Erlang Shen is a Chinese god with a third truth-seeing eye in the middle of his forehead)

38
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,439
Somehow he got one more truth-seeing eye than others.

39
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,430
It's not as easy as you think to put him off.

40
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,999
Let's take a look at you.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,139
You used great effort to cover the blood and hide the weapon.

42
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:13,570
But he still found you out.

43
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,619
I know you hid the thing you stole in Yan Manor.

44
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:23,329
I need to send the interrogation record to Commandery Prince An tonight.

45
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,109
You are a smart woman.

46
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,079
Think about it.

47
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,819
If I hand in the record and Commandery Prince An closes the case,

48
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,909
the thing you hid in Yan Manor will be safe.

49
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,999
Then you can give it to anyone you want.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,030
Just tell me what kind of stuff it is.

51
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,220
Can I trust what you say?

52
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,700
You really hid the thing in Yan's mansion?

53
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,300
You...!

54
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:59,039
[The Imperial Coroner]

55
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,660
[Episode 3]

56
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,959
Your Highness, there are all kinds of people in Chang'an.

57
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,479
This girl is so credulous.

58
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,359
It's dangerous for her to stay in Chang'an.

59
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,319
Should I warn her a little bit?

60
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,439
After all, safety awareness is necessary.

61
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,239
Her parents can say that.

62
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,569
Her relatives and friends can say that.

63
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:22,479
Ordinary people can also say that.

64
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,089
But officials like us can never say that.

65
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:26,769
If the official asks people to be on a defensive day and night

66
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:28,690
and be cautious all the time,

67
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,590
why would the court keep us?

68
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,319
Please calm down. I was wrong.

69
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,780
Your Highness, Miss Chu has finished the autopsy.

70
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,431
- How do you know that?
- What?

71
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:43,040
The words you just said.

72
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,789
The officials can't say that and why would the court keep you...

73
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,099
That's what the Handsome Judge said.

74
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,960
How do you know that?

75
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:57,129
Has the Handsome Judge you've been talking about also said that?

76
00:03:57,129 --> 00:03:58,689
Yes, that's what he said.

77
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:01,239
You have never seen that Handsome Judge,

78
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,960
how do you know what he said?

79
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,159
I heard a lot about him.

80
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,029
He said those words when he was admonishing the corrupt officials.

81
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,109
Where did you hear about his deeds?

82
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,519
I just know it.

83
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,750
You haven't told me how you know these words.

84
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,210
I also heard it from someone else.

85
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,910
How is the autopsy?

86
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,109
I've finished it.

87
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,549
But there is something strange.

88
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,349
Your Higness, can you come with me and check it?

89
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,750
Okay.

90
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,540
The dead were male. He was older than 30 years old.

91
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,890
The cause of death is being shot by a short arrow in the heart.

92
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,169
His legs or feet were fine.

93
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:48,889
He pretended to have a limp.

94
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,479
I should have found it out at the time.

95
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,879
But I panicked.

96
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,919
It's not your fault.

97
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,099
He wanted to hurt you,

98
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,840
he would attack you no matter if you found it out or not.

99
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,960
Although he pretended to have a limp,

100
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,539
he did have many scars on his body.

101
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:05,039
The oldest one is five or six years old.

102
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,829
The newest one is about one month old.

103
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,850
They are all sharp injuries.

104
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,240
He should be someone who used swords and spears a lot.

105
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,220
There is a thick callus on his right hand's purlicue.

106
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,999
Based on the position and the shape of the callus,

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,340
he should use knives a lot.

108
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,130
But... there is one strange thing.

109
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,920
This man used his right hand a lot,

110
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,199
but he was left-handed.

111
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,299
What do you mean by that?

112
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:30,929
The callus on his right hand means he
[Swordsman]

113
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:33,449
often held a knife with his right hand.
[Swordsman]

114
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,949
When he hijacked me, he also held the knife with his right hand.

115
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,010
But the callus caused by writing is on his left hand,
[Scholar]

116
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:44,639
which means he wrote with his left hand and held a knife with his right hand.

117
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,560
A left-handed scholar
[Swordsman Scholar]

118
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,410
and right-handed swordsman. This person was too weird.

119
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,950
What's the difference between me and the man in charge?

120
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,790
A beard.

121
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,540
Isn't it just a beard?

122
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,450
Zhou Han greets Eunuch Qin.

123
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,970
Have you finished it?

124
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,890
It was one step away.

125
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,370
Xiao Jinyu's Chief Guardsman, Wu Jiang

126
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,240
suddenly showed up with his men and took that female coroner away.

127
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:25,050
Did you men fight with Xiao Jinyu's people?

128
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,249
Yes.

129
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:29,460
But we've been very careful to conceal our moves.

130
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,939
The captive was silenced in time.

131
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:35,310
What about the body?

132
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,560
Zhou!

133
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,780
Can't you clean up your own mess now?

134
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,849
Please rest assured.

135
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:00,449
That person never met anyone from the Judicial Service.

136
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:02,700
Xiao Jinyu won't know him.

137
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,590
What a fool.

138
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,760
Please calm down, I'm slow witted.

139
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,240
You are not slow witted.

140
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,720
You are retarded.

141
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,409
Let me ask you.

142
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:23,450
Did your men see the pendant again?

143
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,860
Yes.

144
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,640
But they didn't get it.

145
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,479
Find some clever men and keep a close eye

146
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,910
on Xiao Jinyu and Princess Xiping.

147
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,070
Let me know immediately if anything happens.

148
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,460
Especially when it's about the pendant.

149
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:55,350
What's more, go back and shave the hair around your mouth.

150
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,370
I'll kill everyone in your family

151
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,949
if I see one more hair again.

152
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,069
I know.

153
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,670
Get out!

154
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,600
Master, would Zhou Han, this idiot, implicate us?

155
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,220
Keep an eye on the outside.

156
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,810
Yes sir.

157
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,059
It wouldn't be strange if he was originally in the army.

158
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:32,429
In the army?

159
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,349
A martial art master would hold the weapon with his hand

160
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,229
that he is comfortable with.

161
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,879
But it's different in the army.

162
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,759
The soldier must hold the weapon with the right hand, without exception.

163
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,949
Therefore, the left-handed will become ambidextrous after they join the army.

164
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,279
I just arrived in Chang'an.

165
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,219
I haven't offended anyone who served as a soldier.

166
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,909
You didn't offend him.

167
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,199
It's he who has an eye on you.

168
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,080
On me?

169
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:00,750
I have no money.

170
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,529
- I see.
- What?

171
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:04,710
When he hijacked me,

172
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,029
he told me that he wouldn't kill me if I go with him.

173
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,519
I think he fell in love with me.

174
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,360
He wanted to take me back and make me his wife.

175
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,300
It's getting late.

176
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,779
Miss Chu. You...

177
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,549
Chu Chu, have you found a place to stay in Chang'an?

178
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:24,420
Not yet.

179
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,369
I'm worried that the inn owner doesn't want to take in a coroner.

180
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:29,489
I wanted to find a deserted temple.

181
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:32,049
But there seems to be no deserted temple here.

182
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:35,250
The stores will be closed half an hour later.

183
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,229
I've taken too much of your time today.

184
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,390
You can stay in the Three Judicial Chief Ministries if you want.

185
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,059
It is also convenient for me to discuss these unfinished cases with you at any time.

186
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:46,650
Live in the Three Judicial Chief Ministries?

187
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:50,600
I also live in the Three Judicial Chief Ministries.

188
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,120
Well, do you have other plans for the night?

189
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,730
No. I'm willing to.

190
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,339
I can work for you if you don't mind.

191
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:00,789
I can do anything.

192
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,539
I won't stay there and eat your food for free.

193
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,960
[Three Judicial Chief Ministries]

194
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,399
Miss Chu, please have some tea.

195
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,529
You are...

196
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:18,619
I'm a maidservant here, Lian Qiao.

197
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,129
You can order me if you need anything.

198
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:22,570
No.

199
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,369
- Have you been working here for many years?
- Yes.

200
00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:27,529
You must know a lot about the Prince, right?

201
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:30,300
What do you want to know?

202
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,050
Is the Prince married?

203
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,240
The Prince isn't married.

204
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,760
No way.

205
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,639
How is he not married at this age?

206
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,279
In our Pingle Town, a man at his age should become a father long ago.

207
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,150
The Prince is still young.

208
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,839
How is Miss Chu doing?

209
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,249
Miss Chu has settled down.

210
00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:59,299
Our guards live in Liutao Office.

211
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:01,339
They will report immediately if anything happens.

212
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:03,749
Did she ask you anything about the manor?

213
00:11:03,749 --> 00:11:04,789
Never.

214
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,641
But Miss Chu asked me about a place.

215
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:10,579
- What place?
- Do you know where the Six Gates is?

216
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,640
The Six Gates is the Three Judicial Chief Ministries.

217
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,749
Here?

218
00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:17,209
Not really.

219
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,370
The Six Gates is what the people working in the office call it.

220
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,530
It's a nickname. It's a joke.

221
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,619
No.

222
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:28,059
I'm not talking about this Six Gates, but the Six Gates

223
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:31,190
with constables and the Handsome Judge.

224
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,999
Let her do whatever she wants in the manor

225
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,439
and give her what she wants.

226
00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:39,130
I'd like to see what she's up to.

227
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,470
Does he have someone he likes?

228
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,589
Why are you so interested in the Prince's love life?

229
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,419
I just don't get it.

230
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:52,149
What kind of woman can match such a handsome man like the Prince?

231
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,740
It would be best if she is

232
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,909
a lady with double-fold eyelids and a high nose.

233
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,989
With the appearance of the Prince,

234
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,160
their child will be really good-looking.

235
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,789
I dare not discuss the Prince's personal life.

236
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:09,379
But what you just said, that's how the girls in Chang'an

237
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:11,189
talk about Vice Minister Jing.

238
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,571
It's rare that a girl would praise the Prince the way you do.

239
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:19,080
The girls in Chang'an do have a strange taste.

240
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,710
How handsome the Prince is.

241
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,510
By the way, I also want to know

242
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,389
if there is any work I can do for the Prince.

243
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,210
Anything will do.

244
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,980
Work?

245
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:37,129
Miss Chu asked me to bring you a hot boiled egg.

246
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:38,530
I'm not hungry.

247
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,509
She asked me to peel the egg

248
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,589
and roll it on the wound on your forehead.

249
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:44,869
It can promote blood circulation and disperse blood stasis.

250
00:12:44,869 --> 00:12:46,570
Go ahead.

251
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,569
Your Highness.

252
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:51,719
You've been suspecting Miss Chu's background,

253
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:54,319
but why did you still ask her to do autopsies again and again?

254
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,140
Although she is suspicious,

255
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,240
she is a talented coroner

256
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,650
indeed.

257
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:05,470
She is more gifted than other coroners.

258
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,329
It's not something you can have through learning.

259
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,789
I've heard that those who play zithers or draw need to be gifted.

260
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,199
A coroner's work is to find out how a person dies.

261
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:17,180
Does it make any difference being gifted or not?

262
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,280
For ordinary coroners, a corpse is just a corpse.

263
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,430
But, for her, these corpses seem to be alive.

264
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,020
Alive?

265
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,709
She can feel what they feel and think what they think.

266
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,689
I have never seen such a peculiar coroner like her.

267
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,890
It would be the best

268
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:41,330
if my suspicion of her is just misunderstanding.

269
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,839
If not, I would like to give her a chance

270
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,419
to get back on the right track.

271
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:47,809
I believe that.

272
00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:49,609
Jing Yi was going down the wrong path at that time,

273
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:52,490
but you still pulled him back to the right track.

274
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,880
What?

275
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,789
What do you mean?

276
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,830
Are you asking me to roll away?

277
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,869
Well, I've worked my butt off.

278
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,649
It's under curfew now and I can't go home.

279
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:24,989
I just got here, and you did that to me. Just go.

280
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:28,200
There are snacks from Princess Xiping's Manor.

281
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,100
It's the top grade.

282
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,829
What about the confession?

283
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,600
It's kind of troublesome now.

284
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,469
The scroll you talked about is really hidden in the Yan manor.

285
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,550
I have found it.

286
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,749
But when I took the scroll back to the Court of Judicial Review

287
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,590
and wanted to question that dancing girl, she died of poison.

288
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,729
I have found someone to check her body. It's aconitine.
(T/N: Aconitine poisoning is related to the rapid onset of life-threatening heart rhythm changes.)

289
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,810
Aconitine?

290
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,289
She is a dancing girl.

291
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:08,039
How did she get this highly poisonous herb?

292
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:10,800
She might get it while dancing at some place.

293
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,330
This is the scroll.

294
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,010
This is a book about anecdotes of the Wuzong Dynasty.

295
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,339
Yan Ming wrote a bunch of messy comments next to it.
[Duke Chang The Imperial Family]

296
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:27,099
He seemed to be interested in
[Mystery]

297
00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:28,299
the Emperor Wuzong's young son, Duke Chang.

298
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:29,879
I mean, Yan Ming was a scholar.

299
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,390
He didn't study poems and songs,

300
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,199
but study dead people like coroners.

301
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,710
Yan Ming... might be looking for someone.

302
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,390
Looking for someone?

303
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,639
Who was Yan Ming looking for?

304
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,050
A dead person.

305
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,960
A person that no one can find.

306
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,069
What are you talking about?  I think Yan Ming had nothing better to do.

307
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,759
Anyway, the murderer who killed Yan Ming is already dead.

308
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,399
We can offer an explanation to the Emperor now.

309
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:00,030
Watch your attitude when you go to court tomorrow.

310
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:03,609
My father and Mr. Xue told you many times

311
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:06,609
to make more friends and less enemies.

312
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:08,539
I have no intention of making enemies.

313
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:09,669
That's good.

314
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:14,660
But those who are against truth and justice are my enemies.

315
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,960
Wash your hands that just touched the poison.

316
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,969
I asked the kitchen to save some food for you.

317
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:27,469
You rest here tonight.

318
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,249
Tomorrow morning, go to the Shen Army and ask about

319
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:32,109
if there is a junior officer in his thirties missing

320
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,089
who has been in the army for about five years.

321
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:36,590
Shen Army?

322
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,940
Did those eunuchs cause any trouble again?

323
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,989
When we left Yan Manor today, there were soldiers in disguise

324
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,010
who tried to hijack Miss Chu.

325
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,140
They failed

326
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,770
and used this to kill the captive.

327
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,269
This arrowhead is not something that an ordinary blacksmith can make.

328
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:58,099
This is made by the Crossbow Agency of the Weapon Bureau

329
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:00,940
exclusively for the army in the capital.

330
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:05,060
I asked someone to get it from the Crossbow Agency.

331
00:17:09,481 --> 00:17:11,659
Are you suspecting that someone from the Shen Army tried to hijack Chu Chu?

332
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:12,799
If you verify it

333
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,279
and there is such a person missing in the Shen Army,

334
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,640
then it's not a suspicion anymore.

335
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,019
Qian Printing made copper coins illicitly.

336
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:30,159
The dancing girl.

337
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:31,919
The aconitine.
[Qia]

338
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,140
They are all related to the Southwest.

339
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,580
Why does Prince An care so much about

340
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,680
the witch doctor's pendant?

341
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,119
Yan Ming was killed for looking into the son of the late emperor.

342
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:51,860
The dancer who killed him took poison when she was found out.

343
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,029
Prince An said he is not the Handsome Judge.

344
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:57,000
But why does he know so much about the Handsome Judge?

345
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,130
The case of Yan Ming is not that simple.

346
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,520
Help!

347
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,159
Something bad happened!

348
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,920
Help!

349
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,409
Madam. Madam, are you okay?

350
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:27,910
What happened?

351
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:31,060
Master... Master...

352
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,410
Master died.

353
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,380
Madam.

354
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:45,630
It's okay, Madam. It wasn't me

355
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,750

Have all the chickens of Chang'an flown here to file a complaint?

364
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:30,339
The chickens didn't fly here. Miss Chu bought them.

I asked Lian Qiao to buy these chickens this morning.

384
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,940
I bought them with the wages you gave me.

385
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,999
The chicken in Chang'an is too expensive.

386

If it's in our Pingle Town,

387
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,330
I can at least buy dozens of chickens with this money.

388

Didn't Wu Jiang tell you

389

who wash clothes and cook for you.

394
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,799
You don't need me to do it. I asked them.

395
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:50,090
You didn't raise chickens or grow food here.

396
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,060
There happens to be a vacant plot of land here.

397

So I made use of it for you.

398

After these chickens grow up, they can lay eggs when it gets warmer.

399

Chickens lay eggs, and there will be more chickens.

400
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,760

- Not at all.

Are you going to grow vegetables here?

406
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,290
It's a waste to only raise chickens in such a big area.

407
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,260
But I don't know what should be grown here.

If it's in our Pingle Town, the rice in the backyard

409

is enough to feed the big family for a year.

00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,560
Pack his goods according to the list as soon as possible and send them to him.
[Book of Songs]

536
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,699
Yes.

537
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,759
[illuminate Auspicious]

538
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,469
Master passed away suddenly.

539
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,890
Everything is prepared in a rush.

540
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,800
Please forgive us if we didn't serve you well.

541
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,410
When did Minister Feng return to the capital?

542
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:10,720
What kind of disease caused his sudden death?

543
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,390
Just before the gate closed yesterday, Master entered the capital

544
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,850
and went to the welcome banquet held by his colleagues.

545
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:23,709
It was a laborious trip and he had a few more drinks

546
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,210
which brought about the terrible disease.

547
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:33,390
When you get old, you can't neglect your health.

548
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,279
Scholar Xue is right.

549
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,010
That's how our Madam said to Master.

550
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,110
But Master was busy with official duties

551
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,130
and he turned a deaf ear to her words.

552
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:46,560
I remember that Minister Feng had no sons but three daughters.

553
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,010
Why didn't I see any of them?

554
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:51,500
Their husbands are talking offices outside the capital.

555
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,580
The three ladies are out there with their husbands.

556
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,830
Master passed away suddenly.

557
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:59,290
I'm afraid they won't come back until the day when Master is buried.

558
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,370
What about the Second Lady?

559
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:05,970
Master went to the Southwest for inspections and had been away for long,

560
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,150
he died suddenly just as he came back.

561
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,850
The Second Madam is too sad and she falls sick.

562
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,519
She can't greet guests now.

563
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,030
What's gone is gone. You should comfort her.

564
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,399
Yes.

565
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,580
I'll leave.

566
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,789
Princess. I met Prince An before I left Feng Manor.

567
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:35,799
Jinyu went to Feng Manor to express condolences?

568
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,550
Yes.

569
00:30:36,551 --> 00:30:38,309
Did he go there alone?

570
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,039
He also brought a girl.

571
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,759
I've asked someone and she is a coroner.

572
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,320
Jinyu brought a coroner to Feng Manor to express condolences?

573
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,949
Go to the Three Judicial Chief Ministries and tell Jinyu

574
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,349
that there is something really important.

575
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,809
- If he doesn't come to me, I'll go to see him.
- Yes.

[Funeral]

577
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,930
Good day, Commandery Prince An, Scholar Xue.

578
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,559
What was that about in the mourning hall?

579
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,639
I have some doubts. I want to know the truth.

580
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:12,430
Is there anything wrong?

581
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,759
I haven't found it out.

582
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,559
You are getting crazier.

583
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,590
What if the Emperor knows it?

584
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,950
Good day, sir.

585
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,110
Good day, Senior Jing, Vice Minister Jing.

586
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:42,709
If you have time, come to my mansion and have a simple meal.

587
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:45,499
Father, forget it. If Commandery Prince An comes to our manor,

588
00:31:45,499 --> 00:31:47,900
Mother will introduce girls to him again.

589
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,189
Just give me a break.

590
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,069
What does it have to do with you

591
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,909
- that your mother introduces girls to Commandery Prince An?
- What does it have to do with me?

592
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:57,770
The city gate is on fire, disaster is brought to the fish in the moat.

593
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:00,830
Well... Senior Jing. there have been many trivial matters in the Three Judicial Chief Ministries.

594
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,159
I won't bother you today.

595
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,490
I'll visit Aunt in person some other day.

596
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,589
But I have some official affairs to discuss with Jing Yi.

597
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:11,400
Can you let Jing Yi go back with me?

598
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,970
Okay.

599
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,039
Be serious about your work with Commandery Prince An.

600
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,760
Otherwise, I'll go back and tell your mother about it.

601
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,010
Senior Jing, don't worry.

602
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,520
I'll leave.

603
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,640
What a tattletale.

604
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,950
At lease you parents are healthy.

605

[Feng Manor]

606
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,109
Your Highness, I was really scared.

607
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,639
I thought I was going to give myself away.

608
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,430
You really went there to do an autopsy?

609
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,589
Don't you know that?

610
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:53,040
Then why did you help me out?

611
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:57,159
Commandery Prince An doesn't attend any wedding or funeral.

612
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,650
He brought a coroner to the funeral this time.

613
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,230
Isn't it obvious?

614
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,970
When the fox preaches, take care of your geese.
(T/N: Proverb that says to be aware about hidden agenda)

615
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,290
Fox?

616
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,640
It's just an inappropriate analogy.

617
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,890
Chu Chu, did you find anything from that quick glance?

618
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,610
There is...

619
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:20,800
Hold on. It's time for lunch.

620
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,309
Chu Chu, are you hungry?

621
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,410
I'm a little hungry.

622
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:28,640
I fed the chickens but forgot to feed myself this morning.

623
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,759
Your Highness, considering how hard we tried to help you.

624
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,970
Shouldn't you treat us to a good meal?

625
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:38,109
No, I'm fine. I am healthy.

626
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:39,559
It's okay to be hungry for a while.

627
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,879
No way.

628
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,999
Your brain can't work well when you are hungry

629
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,719
and it's easy to forget stuffs. And it's easy to make mistakes when you think.

630
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:49,219
You are a coroner. Shouldn't you know better than I do?

631
00:33:49,219 --> 00:33:52,630
Okay, let's talk while eating.

632
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,290
What do you want to eat?

633
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,300
[Rugui Tavern]

634
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,150
Vice Minister Jing, please come in.

635
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,050
This is...

636
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,950
This is Commandery Prince An from the Three Judicial Chief Ministries.

637
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,759
I'm Xu Rugui, the owner of Rugui Tavern.

638
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,710
- Greetings to Commandery Prince An.
- You may rise.

639
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,560
Thank you, Your Highness.

640
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:21,429
[Rugui Tavern]

641
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,559
The same old dishes.

642
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,359
Braised pigeon with soy sauce, seared salamander,

643
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,410
and roast lamb ribs.

644
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:28,170
Remember, it must be baby lamb.

645
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,820
Don't roast it for too long.

646
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,689
Get us more dipping sauce. I like you nomads' dipping sauce the most.

647
00:34:33,689 --> 00:34:35,559
Rest assured. I got it.

648
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,279
Commandery Prince An, it's your first time to be here,

649
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,090
may I introduce you our specialties?

650
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,370
No need.

651
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:46,519
I want a flower chicken, a sour fish soup and a houttuynia salad.

652
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,560
Why did Prince An order Qianzhou dishes?

653
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,909
Your Highness, you do know what to eat.

654
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:58,030
Houttuynia is rare in Chang'an.

655
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,799
Only Rugui Tavern has it.

656
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,359
These three dishes ordered by Commandery Prince An

657
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,999
are all authentic Qianzhou cuisine.

658
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,189
There happens to be a cook from Qianzhou.

659
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,070
I won't say that the cooking is superb,

660
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:11,709
but this cook can make the authentic Qianzhou taste.

661
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,120
Commandery Prince An, Vice Minister Jing. Please wait for a while.

662
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,079
The dishes will be ready soon.

663
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,920
Wait!

664
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,910
Get this girl a cup of tea.

665
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,669
Forgive me for being clumsy and neglecting this girl.

666
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,699
It's okay.

667
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,000
Sit down.

668
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,900
This man looks strange.

669
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,740
I'll leave.

670
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,180
Are you a regular here?

671
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,909
Not really.

672
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,429
The food is delicious here. But it's too expensive for me.

673
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:52,190
I won't eat here if no one gives me a treat.

674
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:56,010
Have you known Feng Jie's death?
[Jiangshan Hall]

675
00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:00,810
Your Majesty. I received an obituary from Feng Manor early in the morning.

676
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,840
I went to Feng Manor to offer my condolences.

677
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,429
Minister Feng passed away just after he came back.

678
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,999
The Feng Manor wasn't prepared at all.

679
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,149
It was hectic when I went there.

680
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:14,279
I feel really sorry for them.

681
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,660
The Feng Manor wasn't prepared, wasn't I caught off guard?

682
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,120
Now Feng Jie is gone, someone needs to take over the Ministry of War.

683
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,510
You are right, Your Majesty.

684
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,980
It's easy to talk.

685
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,119
Who can take it over?

686
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,669
Since I took the throne,

687
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:31,070
I've been racking my brains for my country day and night.

688
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:35,230
Everyone in court is trying to consolidate the power of Great Tang

689
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,820
and restore the prosperity.

690
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,730
How important it is to find a talent.

691
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:46,229
Do you think it's that easy to appoint a third-rank minister?

692
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,800
Feng Jie is only in his early fifties.

693
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,570
He is even healthier than those military officers.

694
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,850
How did he die in such a sudden?

695
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:58,849
I heard from Feng's housekeeper that it was a laborious trip to the southwest

696
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:01,319
and he had a few more drinks at the welcome banquet,

697
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,660
which aroused the terrible disease, leading to his sudden death.

698
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,740
What? He died of drinking?

699
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,079
- Prince An, Vice Minister Jing.
- Please enjoy yourselves.

700
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,640
Miss, please enjoy yourselves.

701
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,840
Feel free to tell me if you need anything else.

702
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,770
I'll leave.

703
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,769
Well? These dishes don't suit your appetite?

704
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:36,679
No. I just feel that this owner looks...

705
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,770
It's nothing.

706
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,130
It has been a hard day for you.

707
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,830
Go ahead and eat.

708
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,219
Your Highness. Do you also like Qianzhou food?

709
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,189
I never tasted it before.

710
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,279
My older brother is a general stationed in the Southwest.

711
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,839
He mentioned these Qianzhou dishes before.

712
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,869
Qianzhou is a thousand miles away from Chang'an.

713
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,389
You have left home at least for one month.

714
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:05,130
You haven't had your hometown food for some time, right?

715
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,880
You ordered these dishes for me?

716
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,899
I treat you two to a meal, of course, I should order dishes for you two.

717
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,330
But, Your Highness,

718
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,500
I haven't found the cause of his death.

719
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,869
It doesn't matter.

720
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,060
Fill your stomach first.

721
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,220
Come on, give me the bowl.

722
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,500
Thank you, Your Highness.

723
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,090
Thank you, Your Highness.

724
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,720
It should be true that she was born in Qianzhou.

725
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,349
Chu Chu, are these Qianzhou dishes authentic?

726
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,669
Yeah, they are really authentic.

727
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,980
I'm glad you enjoy them.

728
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,710
Take your time. Don't feel restrained.

729
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,290
Thank you, Your highness.

730
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:14,909
Did you find anything in the mourning hall of the Feng Manor?

731
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:17,319
There are several obvious injuries on Feng Jie's chest.

732
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,220
But those are not to hurt him. But to save him.

733
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,120
Save him? How to save him?

734
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,619
Can I show it to you in person?

735
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,660
You pretend to be Feng Jie. I'll be the one to save him.

736
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,040
Okay.

737
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,450
- What are you doing?
- I'm showing it to you.

738
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:42,119
Minister Feng should be dead now.

739
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,619
You need to relax and lie down with your eyes closed.

740
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,301
You can't move no matter what I do to you.

741
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,430
That should be how Minister Feng got those scratches.
