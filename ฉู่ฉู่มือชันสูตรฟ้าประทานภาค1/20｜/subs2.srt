Timing and subtitles brought to you by The Imperial Coroners @ Viki.com

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,389
For the concern about Chu Chu,

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,919
Chu He let go of Xu Rugui without permission.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,920
The Chu family are all kind.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,019
But Chu Chu has a complicated background.

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,370
It's challenging for them to defend her.

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,509
Tan Gui brought about the old problem of the previous dynasty and Senior Jing.

8
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:24,990
The situation is getting more complicated.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,949
Deputy Magistrate Tan, since you work for Senior Jing,

10
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:33,240
you should know why I came to the Southwest this time.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,530
Senior Jing wants you to kill Chu Chu to avenge my father.

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,649
But if my father wants you to let her go,

13
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:41,739
are you willing to put off killing Chu Chu

14
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:44,489
and tell Senior Jing about the situation first?

15
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:47,140
You mean Prince Consort is still...?

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,190
Since I came to Guanling County, I been confused.

17
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,280
Chu Chu's family background is doubtful.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,480
My father stayed with her for years.

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,139
How could he not figure it out?

20
00:00:57,139 --> 00:00:59,969
But he treated Chu Chu as his own daughter.

21
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,940
So, I guess there's something fishy.

22
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,519
You mean Witch Doctor who contacted the Chu family...?

23
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:10,649
But he's been missing, since five years ago.

24
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:15,350
I guess he's still here.

25
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,549
I'll go look for my father in a couple of days.

26
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:22,599
After I find him, the truth will be known.

27
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:26,569
Now that you want to avenge him, shouldn't you ask him if he wants it?

28
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:31,470
Your Highness, are you serious?

29
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,989
How about this?

30
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,880
You can go with us.

31
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,560
Yes, Your Highness.

32
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,009
I'm sorry, Jing Yi. I was too impulsive.

33
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,159
It was my fault. I should have told you earlier.

34
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:31,080
[The Imperial Coroner]

35
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,859
[Episode 20]

36
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,580
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

37
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,709
Xiao Jinli was so rude. He shouldn't have hit you so hard.

38
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:41,430
Let me check on you.

39
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,659
We're on the street.

40
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:45,089
So what?

41
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:47,930
No one else is around. Let me check on you.

42
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,119
I'm all right.

43
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:50,320
Let me check.

44
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,220
I'm really all right.

45
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,300
I'm glad you're all right.

46
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,930
If Xiao Jinli dares to hurt you again, I'll skin him!

47
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,590
Thank you.

48
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,569
We're friends. You're welcome.

49
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,109
Brother!

50
00:04:38,109 --> 00:04:40,499
Chu Chu, why did you come?

51
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:43,499
Brother, what happened?

52
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:44,770
I'm all right.

53
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,930
I was... I was just flogged.

54
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,079
Flogged? Why were you flogged?

55
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,269
Let me check on you. Which part?

56
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,269
Don't. Don't check on me.

57
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,159
Why can't I?

58
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,619
I'm a man, but you're a girl.

59
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,640
Why do you think?

60
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,109
My job is to inspect wounded or dead bodies.

61
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,620
I checked on a lot of men.

62
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,290
Besides, you also checked on a lot of women.

63
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,399
Why can't I check on you? Let me have a look.

64
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:10,450
Don't. Don't. My good sister, don't worry.

65
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,019
I'm all right.

66
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:13,920
Don't check on me.

67
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,779
Brother, tell me about it.

68
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:25,069
What mistake did you make?

69
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:26,819
Why were you flogged?

70
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:31,950
Grandfather and Father worked for years, but they never got flogged.

71
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:38,760
What big mistake did you make so that Magistrate Zheng flogged you?

72
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,290
No wonder you don't dare to go home.

73
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,900
It wasn't Magistrate Zheng.

74
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,190
Then... His Highness punished you?

75
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,380
No, no.

76
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,940
I did something terrible

77
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,679
and I thought it was a huge mistake.

78
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:58,039
Then I asked to be flogged so that I could feel better

79
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:00,480
and then learn a lesson.

80
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,439
I'm telling you.

81
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,190
No matter what happens to you and when it happens, you must tell me.

82
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,759
Don't keep it bottled up in your heart.

83
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,739
When you were little, you used to tell us everything.

84
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:23,719
But since you came back from Chang'an,

85
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,490
you've kept everything in your mind, instead of telling me.

86
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,200
You only tell that Commandery Prince.

87
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,809
- Brother.
- I know!

88
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:38,199
I'm not as good as him.

89
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,750
He's handsome and virtuous.

90
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,550
Looks like he knows everything and he can handle any problem.

91
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,699
He's a powerful official.

92
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,790
If I were a girl, I would like him, too.

93
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,449
But, Chu Chu, I promise you

94
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:01,190
I will help you with whatever I can!

95
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,100
If he bullies you, I'll punish him for you…

96
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,040
even at the risk of my life!

97
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,439
Brother, you're always my good brother.

98
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,749
I'm always your brother.

99
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:35,550
Rest assured.

100
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,479
You heard Chu He say he wanted to marry Chu Chu?

101
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:45,680
How dare I talk nonsense about it?

102
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:54,160
At least he knows how to be nice to her.

103
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,240
- What?
- Nothing.

104
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,159
What? Having a stomach ache again?

105
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,620
Are you not having your meals regularly?

106
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,139
I told you not to do this!

107
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:07,610
- It doesn't matter.
- It matters.

108
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,970
Take it.

109
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,269
Brother, what are you doing?

110
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:13,870
Brother!

111
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,290
Brother!

112
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,739
Lie down.

113
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:25,109
Brother, I'll be all right soon.

114
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,349
You won't. You don't eat or sleep.

115
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:29,360
Look how pale your face is!

116
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,880
Tell me. What's on your mind?

117
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,830
Since you were little, you've kept everything bottled up.

118
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,999
You don't tell us until you figure it out.

119
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:45,670
But there're countless things in the world.

120
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,120
Can you figure them all out alone?

121
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,149
I don't mean to keep it from you.

122
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:54,490
But my mind is still in a mess.

123
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,439
I don't know how to explain it to you.

124
00:08:57,439 --> 00:08:59,519
Then tell me the mess.

125
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,639
It doesn't matter if it's right or wrong.

126
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,810
You can even complain to me.

127
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,910
Better than holding it to yourself.

128
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,780
Jinyu, remember.

129
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,680
No matter what happens, you have me.

130
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,060
Brother, you don't owe me.

131
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,229
You're not having a fever.

132
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,289
What nonsense are you talking about?

133
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:29,349
I know you've been feeling guilty for many years,

134
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,929
only because I saved you from the water when we were little.

135
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:35,989
So, you always defend me, make concessions to me, and aggrieve yourself.

136
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:38,759
You even let me claim Father's title and be the Commandery Prince.

137
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,539
But, Brother, we're brothers. We should help each other.

138
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:45,930
If it were me who fell into the water,

139
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,500
you would have saved me, too. Right?

140
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:57,390
Jinyu, it's my first time to see you think stupidly.

141
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,690
You saved me from the water when you couldn't swim.

142
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,229
Now you care for me and trust me because I'm your elder brother

143
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,549
and your family. Right?

144
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,790
Then why do I protect you, make concessions to you,

145
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,440
and care for you?

146
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,080
Also, because I'm your elder brother.

147
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,410
It's nothing about guilt.

148
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,779
But, Brother...

149
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:24,349
Jinyu, I let you be the Commandery Prince...

150
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,570
because it suits you more.

151
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,639
I have always loved martial arts. You know that.

152
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,280
We're General Leng's relatives.

153
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,000
If I were the Commandery Prince, would His Majesty

154
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,550
allow me to join the army or become a general?

155
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,809
You're different.

156
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:44,659
You took charge of Three Judicial Offices at such a young age.

157
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:48,129
When you're the Commandery Prince, other officials will be fearful.

158
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:49,510
And you'll be safer.

159
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:55,740
We shouldn't waste the title of nobility Father left us, should we?

160
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,520
It's generous of you, Brother. I was narrow-minded.

161
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,829
That's right, then.

162
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,270
Be gentle, Brother.

163
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,570
You haven't been so hard.

164
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,850
Well, you've grown up and you don't even let me hug you.

165
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,639
All right, I'll save my strength to punch Xu Rugui.

166
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,219
Xu Rugui has confessed that he worked for Qin Luan.

167
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:22,029
His families were kept in the capital as hostages.

168
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:25,079
He failed his mission and escaped.

169
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,559
Considering Qin Luan's temper, he'll kill Xu Rugui's family.

170
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:31,249
I asked Wu Jiang to keep a close eye in the capital.

171
00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:35,180
If someone tries to kill them, Wu Jiang will save them secretly.

172
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,099
Can Wu Jiang do that?

173
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:40,649
One can make great progress in a short period of time.

174
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:43,630
You haven't seen Wu Jiang for a long period of time.

175
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,619
Zhou Han took four men out, heading for Pingkang Residence.
[Three Judicial Offices]

176
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:54,250
Just like what His Highness predicted.

177
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,639
Guys, go catch them with me!

178
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,240

[Romance Brothel]

182
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,679
General Zhou, it's been a long time.

183
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,010
Have you been weak?

184
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,810
- I've been too busy. Shut up.
- Welcome next time.

185
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,109
General Zhou, you haven't come for days.

186
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,450
I've been busy.

187
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,930
I just got off duty and I'm coming to relax with my men.

188
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:30,949
You had a long day, generals. Come in, please.

189
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:34,380
Guard at the door. Go.

190

- Rest assured.
- Come in, please.

191
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,079
- Be quick.
- This way.

192
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,640
- Don't worry. Everything's all right.
- I was too busy. Or I'd come earlier.

193
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,299
Are Xu Rugui's family all here?

194
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:11,330
Yes.

195

Don't worry, General Zhou.

196
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,210
His wife, a concubine, two sons, and a daughter are locked up.

Having not worked for days, you can't even recognize it?

201
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:37,859
I can. I can.

202
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,889
General Zhou, may I ask for a favor?

203
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:43,450
Xu Rugui's concubine looks quite pretty.

204
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,879
It's a pity if she dies like that.

205

Feed it to her or to yourself!

Shall I make you a night-soil woman next time?

211
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:02,099
Don't. Don't! Don't get angry, General Zhou.

212
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:03,909
I didn't mean it.

213
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,559
Don't worry. I'll handle them efficiently.

214
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:10,350
Do I need to teach you how to handle the corpses?

215
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,319
No. No.

216
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:14,539
I would claim girls and waiters of our brothel died of disease

217
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:17,149
and take them to unmarked common graves.

218
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:19,679
Don't worry. Nothing will go wrong.

That's more like it.

00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:26,330
By the way, is Chunxiang in?

221

Yes. When you didn't come, she was missing you.

00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:33,809
- Get her to me.
- Please wait. I'll ask the girls to serve you.

Eunuch Qin, taste this.

228
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,909
It's a new dish the Imperial Cook invented, Luck and Joy Soup.

229
00:15:16,909 --> 00:15:20,149
It's made of ingredients just offered from Yangzhou.

230
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:22,970
His Majesty hasn't tasted it yet.

231
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,980
Let me have a try.

232
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,900
Master.

233
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,230
It doesn't matter. He's one of us.

234
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:47,230
Zhou Han sent a message that Xu Rugui's family were all killed.

235

He finally fulfilled a mission.

237
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,200
Come on. Have it with us.

238

Jinbao, get him a bowl of Joy and Luck Soup.

239
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,380
All right, Eunuch Qin.

240
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,389
Eunuch Qin, it's not Joy and Luck Soup.

241
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:13,490
It's Luck and Joy Soup.

242
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,419
All right. Luck and joy.

243
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:17,320
Thank you, Master.

244
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,350
Jinbao, I have something to ask you.

245
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,839
What did His Majesty say about the marriage

246
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,149
between Xiao Jinli and Leng Yue?

247
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,999
His Majesty complained today.

248
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:33,419
Then he mentioned that Princess Xiping wanted

249
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:36,419
to divine the birthdays of Xiao Jinli and Leng Yue,

250
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:38,219
but she hasn't replied yet.

251
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:40,340
She's obviously stalling for time.

252
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,970
But His Majesty didn't say much, because he thought I was around.

253
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:55,110
His Majesty cares so much about their marriage.

254
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:00,479
I'm afraid he'll use it to deal with Leng Peishan.

255
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:06,570
Leng Peishan must have done something in the Southwest.

Who's behind it?

260
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,129
- Mingde.
- Yes.

261
00:17:21,129 --> 00:17:24,250
Shen Yu, the new Capital Liaison Representative.

262
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,129
Where does he come from?

263
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,799

264
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,380
He's from Wuhou County, Qianzhou.

265
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,679
It's where Duke Chang used to live.

266
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,570
Master, why do you ask?

267
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:44,170
Jinbao, His Majesty needs you.

268
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,730
I understand.

269
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,790
Enjoy your meal, Eunuch Qin. I'll leave you alone.

I'll find out who's behind him.

276
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,679
Speaking of it, Miss Chu is so poor.

277
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,439
She nearly died before she was born.

278
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,050
She hasn't even seen her father.

279
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:56,599
So far, she hasn't even eaten or drunk anything from the Yun family.

280
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,860
In the end, she's involved in her father's case.

281
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,699
You're quite different towards Chu Chu.

282
00:19:03,699 --> 00:19:07,769
She annoyed me many times, but you've never complained about her.

283
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:11,199
If someone else annoyed me, you would have kept punching him

284
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,500
and never stopped.

285
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,520
I'm not blind.

286
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,799
I see clearly who annoys you deliberately and who's nice to you.

287
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,220
And I see clearly if you're really angry or only complaining.

288
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:27,489
Apart from anything else, Miss Chu has been really nice to you.

289
00:19:27,489 --> 00:19:31,280
Speaking of that, I don't even do as well as her.

290
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,539
If I were you, I wouldn't want to arrest her, either.

291
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,699
I can't execute Chu Chu now.

292
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:40,719
There's another reason, besides what I told Tan Gui.

293
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:41,799
What is it?

294
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:46,480
Before I left the capital, Mother urged me to look out for eunuchs.

295
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,639
She said Father would also remind me that.

296
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:51,069
At first, I thought Mother worried

297
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:53,479
I might be involved in the conflict between the ministers and eunuchs.

298
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:57,560
But I found a eunuch's corpse in Father's house.

299
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,499
Xu Rugui confessed that he worked for Qin Luan.

300
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:03,579
Mother must have reminded me for a reason.

301
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:05,639
And Father's chess game.

302
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:07,660
I haven't figured it out,

303
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,100
but I feel that there's something secret

304
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,549
about what Father suffered in the Southwest, besides the official records.

305
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:17,209
So, even if Chu Chu is really the daughter of a rebel,

306
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,179
I can't execute her casually.

307
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,820
Brother, please don't tell Chu Chu what happened tonight.

308
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,030
She was quite scared by what Xu Rugui did.

309
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:30,230
If she knows someone wants to kill her, she'll be terribly anxious.

310
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,510
You can't execute her or you don't want to?

311
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,459
I believe you won't act according to sentiment.

312

You're bullying yourself.

I told Jinyu already. Don't worry.

Not about him.

340
00:23:22,389 --> 00:23:25,880
I want to ask something... about His Highness.

341
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,249
He? He was in a fit of anger yesterday.

00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,229
If His Highness sees someone who has a blood feud with him,

356
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:12,830
will he be angry and sad?

357
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:16,059
He will when he sees a normal foe.

358
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:19,220
But this is also very complicated.

359
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,819
I can't explain clearly.

360
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:23,110
You'd better ask him.

361
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:26,469
I understand. Thank you, General Xiao.

362
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,440
I didn't say anything wrong, did I?

363
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:39,460
That's what Jing Yi says when he coaxes people.

364
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,529
Thank you.

365
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:56,160
You're welcome. I prepared it when cooking.

366
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,169
You have a stomach problem.

367
00:24:57,169 --> 00:24:58,980
If you don't have some hangover soup after you drink,

368
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,060
you'll have a stomach ache.

369
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,890
It's...?

370
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,189
It's a mirror.

371
00:25:04,189 --> 00:25:07,799
One side is convex and the other side is concave.

372
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:14,360
With this mirror, you don't need to go into a place without windows.

373
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,940
I won't tell anyone about it.

374
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:23,790
Let's make a pinky promise.

375
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,250
Your Highness, Miss Chu has come.

376
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,940
Your Highness.

377
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,889
Chu He's room is right ahead.

378
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:45,730
The third room after you turn left.

379
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,980
Your Highness, I've checked on my brother.

380
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,909
Then you can go back home.

381
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,810
I didn't summon you.

382
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:01,160
Your Highness... I came to say thank you on behalf of my brother.

383
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,270
Thank you for the medicine you gave him.

384
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,630
You can leave, then.

385
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,730
I have something to give you.

386
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,199
Give it to the guard at the door.

387
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:23,469
No.

388
00:26:23,469 --> 00:26:26,939
I... I must give it to you personally. I can give it to no one, but you.

389
00:26:26,939 --> 00:26:30,549
I'll leave after I give it to you. I won't come to annoy you again.

390
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,410
Come in, then.

391
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,860
Your Highness.

392
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,520
What is it that you must give me personally?

393
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:19,089
I got it back from the river this morning.

394
00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:20,819
You got it back?

395
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,620
Who did you go with?

396
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,939
No... No one.

397
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,910
Who did you tell before you went there?

398
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,590
No... No one.

399
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,509
Don't worry, Your Highness. I told no one.

400
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,949
I went there alone.

401
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,310
After I got it, I came back.

402
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,459
Ridiculous!

403
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,920
You went there alone, without telling anyone?

404
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,089
It's been raining these days.

405
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,489
The water level has been rising.

406
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,089
What if something happened to you?

407
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:47,410
No one would know where you went.

408
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,760
What would I...

409
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,620
What would we do?

410
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,740
What would your family do?

411
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,249
Don't you remember how worried they were when Chu He was missing?

412
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,610
Yesterday, you risked your life for Chu He.

413
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,539
Today, you risked your life for such trash.

414
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,600
You don't even know how precious your life is.

415
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,080
How can you be a coroner?

416
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,680
Don't get angry, Your Highness. I know I was wrong.

417
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,839
♫ I only see sadness ♫

418
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:22,040
Were you hurt

419
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,830
when you got it from the river?

420
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,531
No.

421
00:28:25,531 --> 00:28:29,200
♫ And see this world ♫

422
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,609
Go back home. And ponder over your fault.

423
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:35,620
You mustn't leave home without my permission.

424
00:28:36,509 --> 00:28:38,710
I know you don't want to see me anymore.

425
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,510
But I want to beg you for something.

426
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,899
One last thing.

427
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,199
Let me go with you to look for Sir Witch Doctor.

428
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,150
After we find him, I won't annoy you anymore.

429
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:51,960
No matter how you want to punish me, I'll accept it.

430
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,899
Is that what you really think?

431
00:28:53,900 --> 00:29:00,400
♫ Stay with each other gently ♫

432
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,401
Please allow me, Your Highness.

433
00:29:01,401 --> 00:29:07,200
♫ Spend our lives through time ♫

434
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,799
♫ Every time we see the setting sun ♫

435
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,139
♫ Every time we look back ♫

436
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,379
♫ We're by each other's side ♫

437
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,200
Stand up. Do as you wish.

438
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,930
Thank you, Your Highness.

439
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,010
Leave.

440
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:34,890
♫ Let time pass by ♫

441
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:43,070
♫ I'm still in love with you ♫

442
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,180
What are you doing?

443
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,070
What are you doing?

444
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,060
Why did you hit me?

445
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,849
You were so stealthy that you scared me!

446
00:29:57,849 --> 00:30:00,330
I was stealthy?

447
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:03,900
Xiao Jinli, you were peeking over his window stealthily.

448
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,330
Were you watching him getting changed or having a bath?

449
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:09,189
If you talk nonsense again, I'll kick you to the wall! Do you believe it?

450
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:13,229
I do, General Xiao.

451
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,380
You know what?

452
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,479
This morning, I was going to search for Xu Rugui.

453
00:30:17,479 --> 00:30:22,480
But I found that Miss Chu sneaked to Yong'an River.

454
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,940
I lost her near the river.

455
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,960
When I found her again,

456
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,100
I saw her coming out of the river.

457
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,539
Then she came here.

458
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,399
I didn't know what she was up to

459
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,130
and I was afraid Tan Gui would try to kill her again.

460
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,430
So, I followed her back.

461
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,130
Why did you follow Chu Chu in the early morning,

462
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,900
instead of searching for Xu Rugui?

463
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,250
You like her?

464
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,669
Nonsense! It's not me who likes her!

465
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:02,389
Come on, Xiao Jinli!

466
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,909
It's not you?

467
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,960
You mean you know someone else likes her?

468
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,629
I'm warning you.

469
00:31:11,629 --> 00:31:13,269
Keep your mouth shut and don't tell anyone about it!

470
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,399
Do you hear me?

471
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,000
Do you?

472
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,749
Xiao Jinli! Could you stop pushing others like this?

473
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:27,229
It's in broad daylight.

474
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,580
Why did you push me?

475
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,719
I pushed you, so what?

476
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,479
You!

477
00:31:31,479 --> 00:31:32,699
What's wrong with that?

478
00:31:32,699 --> 00:31:34,009
What's wrong?

479
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:35,289
Push me, then.

480
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:37,989
I... I'm telling you, Xiao Jinli.

481
00:31:37,989 --> 00:31:39,179
I'm warning you!

482
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:43,479
If you touch me again, I'll go tell Leng Yue and let her skin you!

483
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,030
You've got a defender?

484
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:48,420
I want to see how she can skin me!

485
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,170
Have something to eat, Your Highness.

486
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:02,500
Still angry with Chu Chu?

487
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,239
I may hurt her if I'm too serious.

488
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:06,289
But she won't keep it in mind if I'm not serious enough.

489
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:08,359
I was so anxious that I scolded her just now.

490
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:11,260
But she thought I didn't want to see her again!

491
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,160
I'm so angry!

492
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,509
What are you laughing at?

493
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:19,359
Chu Chu's always imagining things, and you care for her too much.

494
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:22,130
It's more interesting to look at you than reading novels.

495
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:23,730
Here.

496
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,530
Your Highness, I always listen to you.

497
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:31,230
But this time, you should listen to me.

498
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,479
A human heart is like food.

499
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,929
You should have it when it's warm.

500
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:37,599
If you don't eat it, it'll get cold.

501
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:40,920
Even if you heat it again, the taste will change.

502
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,880
Considering what has happened, it's hard for you to accept her now.

503
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,720
But when you make up your mind to do something, you will make it.

504
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,180
Think about it. If her heart for you gets cold, do you want it?

505
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,959
What about you?

506
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:59,250
I don't want it.

507
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:03,179
To be honest, you're a good official and a good brother.

508
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,960
But to a girl,

509
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,170
you can't be a good husband.

510
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:12,599
You keep staying at home, doing nothing, but work.

511
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:15,950
When Chu Chu sees a bigger world, you could be attract her.

512
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,860
I'm talking about Jing Yi.

513
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,679
Why does it concern Jing Yi?

514
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,479
When you were away from Chang'an,

515
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,000
Jing Yi's family arranged blind dates for him

516
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,169
even more than laws I punished him to copy.

517
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:30,230
But he rejected without thinking.

518
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:34,320
Everyone knows that he has a high demand for girls.

519
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,719
He doesn't have a high demand.

520
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,110
He has a girl he likes.

521
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,699
Who... Who does he like?

522
00:33:43,699 --> 00:33:46,009
Go ask him. He will tell you.

523
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:47,839
Your Highness, don't do this to me!

524
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,870
I'm going to have the porridge.
[General]

525
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,700
Please go boil the medicine for me.

526
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,810
We're going to the mountain this afternoon. I must get prepared.

527
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,510
To the mountain?

528
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:10,909
If Father used the light spots in the drawing to indicate his whereabouts,

529
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:13,760
what were the four chess pieces used for?

530
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,560
Miss Leng, why did Deputy Magistrate Tan come?

531
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,740
According to His Highness, Deputy Magistrate Tan is a native

532
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,159
and he's familiar with Phoenix Mountain.

533
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,509
He may help us.

534
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,879
I asked General Xiao to warn His Highness that

535
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,309
Deputy Magistrate Tan might be a bad man.

536
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,099
Does His Highness no longer trust me?

537
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,029
No. That was a misunderstanding.

538
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,839
Deputy Magistrate Tan has explained to His Highness.

539
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,309
- Really?
- Sure.

540
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,679
That's great.

541
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,429
Deputy Magistrate Tan is the best-tempered official.

542
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:54,319
He's always nice when talking to people, even to me.

543
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,639
I'm so glad that he isn't a bad man.

544
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,919
But then I wronged him.

545
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,559
Was he rebuked by His Highness?

546
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,749
Will it do harm to his career?

547
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,609
He's all right.

548
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:07,940
When we go back, I'd better apologize to him.

549
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:14,330
Is it the map of Phoenix Mountain?

550
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,839
I copied it from Zheng Youde.

551
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:18,920
[Phoenix Mountain]

552
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,020
Where are we heading?

553
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,160
[Phoenix Mountain]

554
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,460
He's in the mountain.

555
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,000
You mean Father is on the mountain?

556
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,999
Father had difficulty moving about.

557
00:35:40,999 --> 00:35:44,739
When he left five years ago, the bridge available to carriages wasn't built yet.

558
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:47,460
One couldn't leave Guanling County unless he used a rope.

559
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,950
Considering Father's condition, he couldn't leave alone.

560
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:55,470
He left all the clues in his house, indicating where he had gone.

561
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,929
The light spots in the drawing
[Phoenix Mountain]

562
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:03,090
indicated the southwest of Phoenix Mountain.

563
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,559
Is there any shelter over there?

564
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:07,949
There?

565
00:36:07,949 --> 00:36:10,039
There isn't any shelter.

566
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:12,600
That's a wetland. There's a big swamp,

567
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,129
with many vipers and scorpions. It's a very dangerous place.

568
00:36:15,129 --> 00:36:17,730
Few people go there.

569
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:23,420
Do you mean Prince Consort went there?

570
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,969
He had difficulty moving about.

571
00:36:26,969 --> 00:36:30,600
That's a complex area with no food or fresh water.

572
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,110
If he went there, I'm afraid he could barely survive.
