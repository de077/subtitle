Chu Chu, I want to spend every day with you

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,630
and take care of you for the rest of my life.

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,600
Will you marry me?

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,890
I can do whatever he asks me to do.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,460
But... But I can't marry him.

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,900
She obviously likes me.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,520
But why won't she marry me?

[Guanling County Office]

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,800
I can't intervene in the affairs of the Three Judicial Offices.

11
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,260
You can decide for yourself.

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,289
But it's the emperor's order to bring Chu Chu back to Chang'an.

13
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:50,029
Either I take her back or I take back the truth of Commandery Prince An Consort's case.

14
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:52,240
I don't mean to offend you,

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,779
but neither Chu Chu nor the evidence about my father's case

16
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:56,950
can be taken away by you.

17
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,880
It's not that I don't trust you,

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,550
I just can't trust those guards around you from the Shence Army.

19
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,279
It concerns the Division of Eunuchs.

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,599
It's too important.

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,900
I have to be careful enough.

22
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,570
However, if you only want to report on your mission,

23
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,060
I can let you take Xu Rugui back.

24
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,700
Xu Rugui?

25
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,460
Xu Rugui is Chu Chu's uncle.

26
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,530
Chu Chu's biological mother turned to him for help,

27
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,309
but he killed her to keep himself safe.

28
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,630
Then he threw himself onto the lap of Qin Luan and became his minion.

29
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,629
He was ordered by Qin Luan to arrest Chu Chu in Qianzhou

30
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,839
in order to get one step ahead and find my father.

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,630
Now he has failed and Qin Luan abandoned him and wants to kill him.

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,389
Wu Jiang saved his family secretly in Chang'an.

33
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,250
If you bring him back to Chang'an

34
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,290
and promise him to give his family a way out,

35
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:57,040
Xu Rugui will tell the truth in front of the emperor.

36
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,660
Then the emperor will know that Chu Chu is in danger now.

37
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,920
I will draw up another memorial to explain the cause in detail

38
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,970
and implore him to allow me to finish the affairs in Qianzhou first.

39
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,939
Then, I'll bring Chu Chu back to Chang'an to apologize for our offense.

40
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:14,140
You can report on your mission this way.

41
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,860
Yes, I can.

42
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,889
But if anything goes wrong, you will be blamed and punished.

43
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:28,730
I'm willing to bear all the consequences.

44
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,869
It's just that Qin Luan won't give up easily.

45
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,090
If you are going to bring Xu Rugui back to Chang'an,

46
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,930
you must take strict precautions along the way.

47
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,880
Your Highness, there is an imperial edict.

48
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,220
Here is the imperial edict.

49
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,419
"The illegal minting of coins in Qianzhou

50

disturbed the people and broke the law,

51

damaged the people's livelihood and the national fortune.

52
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,580
Commandery Prince An, Xiao Jinyu, is known for his ability in court

53
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,170
to solve difficult and strange cases,

54
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,569
and is the right person to investigate and handle

55
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,699
the case of illegal minting of copper coins in Qianzhou.

56
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:11,449
From today on, Commandery Prince An is given

57
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:13,979
the power to act at his discretion.

58
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,320
All the officials in Qianzhou are at his disposal."

59
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,420
Respect this.

60
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,000
Minister Xiao Jinyu receives the edict and thanks Your Majesty.

61
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,849
Commandery Prince An, I need to rush back to Chang'an and report on my mission.

62
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:45,030
I should leave.

63
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,239
By the way, before I left Chang'an, Senior Jing asked me

64
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:52,090
to bring you a message.

65
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,549
Qianzhou is dangerous.

66
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:57,620
You must be careful.

67
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,280
Thank you very much.

68
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,760
I should leave.

69
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,930
Sir, now I'm ordered by the emperor to investigate the case of illegal minting of coins.

70
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,470
I can't return to Chang'an before I solve this case.

71
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,490
I hope you can agree with what I just said.

72
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,349
All right.

73
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,899
Since you have the power to act at your discretion,

74
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:32,279
you can keep Chu Chu here in the name of investigating the case

75
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,430
and this can be an explanation to the emperor.

76
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,520
Without delay, I'll set off immediately

77
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,529
and bring Xu Rugui back to Chang'an

78
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,750
lest the treacherous man gets the news.

79
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,740

- Your Highness.

83
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,960
Is there anything you need me to do?

84
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,180
No.

85
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,930
I was...

86
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,720
abrupt last night.

87
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,699
It was busy just now and I didn't have time to talk to you.

88
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:10,350
I'm here to apologize to you.

89
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,020
Here are some rouge and powder.

90
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,319
It took me a long time to pick it.

91
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,600
I still feel that it's not good enough for you.

92
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,219
But it's the best I can find.

93
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,950
If you take it, it means you forgive me.

94
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,439
Your Highness, I'm not blaming you.

95
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,960
I can't take this.

96
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,519
I'm a coroner and I spend a lot of time with corpses.

00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,760
I...

98
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,070
I might not smell good.

99
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,849
But distinguishing the smell is very important for an autopsy.

100
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:45,169
If I use powder, the result will be inaccurate.

101
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:47,839
If it bothers you, I will stay away from you.

102
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:50,270
That's not what I meant.

103
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,350
Then I will take this back.

104
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,750
I have one more thing for you.

105
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,879
I saw it on my way here.

106
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,680
You popped up in my mind when I saw it.

107
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,780
So I picked it for you.

108
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,460
Thank you, Your Highness.

109
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,970

Nothing.

111
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,420
I forgot that a coroner doesn't use powder.

112
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,930
But why did she throw your flowers into the swill bucket?

113
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,979
Did you say exactly what I told you?

114
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,380
Yes, exactly.

115
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,510
It was my first time to say such wild words.

116
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,810
How could I remember it wrong?

117
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,450
That's weird.

118
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,250
That doesn't sound like something Chu Chu would do.

119
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,520
What flowers did you give her?

120
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,910
As you said, inconspicuous at first glance,

121
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,740
but exquisitely beautiful when you look carefully.

122
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,180
This is good.

You came just at the right time.

You are close to Chu Chu. Help us analyze it.

Commandery Prince An sent flowers to Chu Chu.

127

Chu Chu said thanks and threw the flowers into the swill bucket.

128

Flowers? This one?

129
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,860
Yeah.

This is Lespedeza. It can be used as medicine.

131
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,870
But normally people use it to feed pigs.

132
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,909
No wonder she threw it into the swill bucket.

133
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,819

[Lespedeza | Used to feed pigs]

135
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,250

You two, get out.

137
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,529
You came up with that bad idea of sending flowers and rouge to her, right?

138
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:46,379
What do you mean by "that bad idea"?

139
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,229
Isn't this a necessary step to please a girl?

140
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,679
Who would've known that Chu Chu is such an otherworldly person?

141
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:58,280
Jinyu, is what Jing Yi said true?

142
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,009
A necessary step to please a girl.

There is one.

Who?

149
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:26,219
Never mind. Perhaps she doesn't like me at all, and it's just my wishful thinking.

150
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,779
You can tell me.

151
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,680
I...

152
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,980
I can give you some advice

153

154
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,659

155
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:41,220
Then you need to teach me, step by step.

156
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,759
I mean, how could you listen to Jing Yi about such a kind of thing?

157
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:49,680
Do you have any good ideas?

158
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,060
What good idea can I have?

159
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,129
You are really being desperate.

160
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:59,000
Let me ask you. Has Miss Chu ever adored Jing Yi?

161
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,609
It means Jing Yi's method doesn't work on Miss Chu at all.

162
00:12:03,609 --> 00:12:06,720
No wonder it didn't work out. Right?

163
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,700
You have a point.

164
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,080
But I don't know whom Chu Chu adored before.

165
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,300
Who do you want her to adore?

166
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,370
You know it.

167
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,710
That's it.

168
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,880
Now it's you who wants her love.

169
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,860
So you should do it in your own way...

170
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,550
and follow your heart.

171
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,270

You've suffered a lot from searching the mountains during the past few days.

When I used to go into the mountains to suppress bandits,

175

00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,060
Your Highness, the Prefect of Qianzhou, Li Zhang, presents himself.

180
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,449
Greetings to Commandery Prince An and Vice Minister Jing.

181
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:19,810
Did you come here so late for Chu Chu?

182
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:23,739
No, no. I was in a hurry before and I acted recklessly.

183
00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:27,790
I still owe you an apology for my offense.

184
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:33,320
Then, why are you here?

185
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,229
Commandery Prince An, Vice Minister Jing and I talked about

186
00:13:38,229 --> 00:13:40,589
the illegal minting of coins in Qianzhou on that day.

187
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,129
I know that this matter is of great importance.

188
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:48,660
It took me some effort and I found out some clues about the case.

189
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,980
Today, I received the imperial edict that all the officials in Qianzhou

190
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,480
should fully assist Commandery Prince An to investigate this case.

191
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm here to report it to you.

192
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,439
During these days, I've checked the production

193
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,690
of all mines under my control.

194
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,780
I asked my people to take the fake coins

195
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,661
and consult the local experienced miners one by one.

196
00:14:12,661 --> 00:14:15,660
After comparisons, I came to the conclusion
[Investigation of Illegal Minting of Coins in Qianzhou]

197
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,690
that the coins should be made from

198
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,880
copper and tin ore in the Guanling Mountain area.

199
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,900
I've written the detailed process of investigation

200
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,350
and the results in the case file.

201
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,660
Thank you for your efforts.

202
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,289
This is what I should do.

203
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:34,379
Prefect Li, I spend a lot of money,

204
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:37,980
but I don't know much about making money.

205
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,849
Please favor me with your instruction.

206
00:14:40,849 --> 00:14:44,599
I dare not. Please favor me with your instruction.

207
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:50,669
In your opinion, why would these people mint coins illegally?

208
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,170
Why...?

209
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,780
They mint coins for profits.

210
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,120
Where do the profits come from?

211
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,450
I'm slow-witted. Please enlighten me.

212
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,859
Let me put it this way.

213
00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:11,340
The coins don't come out of nowhere.

214
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,340
It requires a lot of manpower and material resources to mint coins.

215
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,450
Normally the coins they made for profits

216
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:20,410
are in poor quality and light.

217
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,229
The cost of minting a coin

218
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,690
is much lower than the face value of a coin.

219
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,820
Then their efforts are not wasted. Am I right?

220
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,539
You are right, Vice Minister Jing.

221
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:32,439
That's weird.

222
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:36,019
The current batch of fake coins minted in Qianzhou

223
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,849
looks just like the genuine coins

224
00:15:38,849 --> 00:15:42,789
in terms of the fineness, the texture, and the weight.

225
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:46,279
It can be seen that they used some good materials and a lot of labor.

226
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,149
The cost can be imagined.

227
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,879
If it's just for this little profit, why don't they do something else

228
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,100
but such a dangerous thing?

229
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,590
Vice Minister Jing is scrupulous indeed.

230
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,570
I never thought about this.

231
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,230
Your Highness, what do you think?

232
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,899
Why bother with this now?

233
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,280
We can ask the supervisors after we find the mint.

234
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,229
You are right, Your Highness.

235
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,140
Your Highness, I think the mint is very likely

236
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,540
in the Phoenix Mountain in Guanling County.

237
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,550
Prefect Li, that's also what we think.

238
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,710
Do you also think so?

239
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,620
If you don't mind us usurping your authority,

240
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,330
we want to go to the mountain with you tomorrow.

241
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,810
Okay, I'm much relieved

242
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,930
if you two come with me.

243
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,010
Are we all going to the mountain tomorrow?

244
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,450
Tomorrow, you lead the troop

245
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,840
and follow me and Li Zhang into the mountain to find the mint.

246
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,369
Jing Yi, Leng Yue, and Zheng Youde

247
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,299
will take some runners to the tree hole

248
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,040
and round off the case of Xu Rugui.

249
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,580
What about Miss Chu?

250
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,369
If I don't let her come, she will come after she knows it.

251
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,899
I will be misunderstood

252
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,849
and I'm afraid I can't explain it for the rest of my life.

253
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:22,010
It's perilous in the mountains,

254
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,870
instead of letting her run around alone,

255
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:27,510
it will be safer to keep her close to me.

256
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:30,499
You are right. There is one more thing.

257
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:37,080
Did Mr. Xue mention the marriage of me and Leng Yue before he left?

258
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,939
He said it's a blessing in disguise.

259
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,640
It's good for you to marry Leng Yue.

260
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,250
What?

261
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,720
I mean, what is Mr. Xue thinking about?

262
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,530
Leng Yue is not that bad, right?

263
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,350
Why are you also making it worse? No.

264
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,969
Is it about whether she is good or bad?

265
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,310
It will get people killed.

266
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:06,629
What will get people killed is the power struggle behind this marriage, not Leng Yue.

267
00:18:06,629 --> 00:18:11,820
Don't you think Leng Yue is a good girl?

268
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,419
You are my real brother indeed.

269
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:15,099
How can you ask me at this point?

270
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:19,350
I'm just asking you if Leng Yue is a good girl.

271
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,800
Yes, Leng Yue is a good girl.

272
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,819
But I'm just like you.

273
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,299
I always see her as a good friend.

274
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,419
I never thought of marrying her.

275
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,269
So I'm saying you and Leng Yue are both victims.

276
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:35,480
But you are still hurting each other.

277
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,950
Hold on!

278
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:43,609
Mr. Xue didn't say anything about a blessing in disguise, right?

279
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:47,179
Well done. You got the nerve to make fun of your big brother.

280
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,430
I'm not in the mood to make fun of you.

281
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,209
It's just that things are getting more complicated in Qianzhou.

282
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,100
I don't want you two to be at odds in the face of our enemies.

283
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,489
You are a general.

284
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,359
You should know better than I do

285
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,299
that trust can be a matter of life and death sometimes.

286
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,519
Yes, you are right.

287
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,700
I'm going to fight...

288
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,400
To have a good chat with her.

289
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,360
My Lord.

290
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,810
Everything is prepared as you ordered.

291
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,550
Get more people to follow them into the mountain tomorrow.

292
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:49,580
I want to see how lucky Xiao Jinyu is.

293
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,820
Xiao Jinli will also bring soldiers to protect him tomorrow.

294
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,520
Well...

295
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,100
What?

296
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,249
Don't worry, My Lord.

297
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,031
You are resourceful and you can capture your enemy easily.

298
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,560
Xiao Jinyu won't come back alive this time.

299
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,360
You can leave.

300
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,280
Are you sure about it?

301
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,799
Don't worry. I've made a thorough plan.

302
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:31,209
Xiao Jinyu will take the bait.

303
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,939
If it's done, the irrefutable proof that we mint coins

304
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,490
will be gone forever.

305
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,799
Then go ahead and do it.

306
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,510
I won't fail you.

307
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,380
You mustn't take it lightly.

308
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:48,290
Xiao Jinyu is on guard against you.

309
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,459
So what if he is on guard against me?

310
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,499
Xiao Jinyu is ordered to investigate the case.

311
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,640
He will take the bait if he sees one.

312
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,329
This place is rarely visited indeed.

313
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,459
We've been walking for a while and there are no people at all.

314
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,009
Of course. There is nothing here.

315
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:10,499
It has been rainy recently.

316
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:12,559
There are even fewer people going into the mountain.

317
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,739
General Xiao, what place are we looking for in the mountains?

318
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:18,660
Ask Commandery Prince An.

319
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,349
A place to mint coins.

320
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:24,549
Mint coins? Shouldn't the government mint coins?

321
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,670
Why would we come to Phoenix Mountain?

322
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,300
Some people are illegally minting coins in Qianzhou.

323
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,409
Prefect Li found out that the ore used for minting coins

324
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,859
is from the mountains in Guanling County.

325
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,829
He suspects that the mint is in Phoenix Mountain.

326
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,630
Here?

327
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,150
Magistrate Zheng.

328
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,089
I heard from Chu Chu that a lot of people have fallen in here.

329
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:01,849
If Commandery Prince An didn't say it in front of your face today,

330
00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:04,829
I think you would only fill the hole when you had fallen in there yourself.

331
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,619
Yes, yes. No, No.

332
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:08,419
No, no.

333
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:10,319
I'm shameful.

334
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:13,030
I'm guilty.

335
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,599
Fill the hole carefully.

336
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:17,939
Don't damage the roots of the tree.

337
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:19,640
Yes.

338
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,539
It's a felony to illegally mint coins.

339
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:26,989
This group of people is so bold.

340
00:22:26,989 --> 00:22:29,309
They must be well prepared.

341
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:34,260
The mint they chose must be a hidden and a convenient place.

342
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,550
Do you have any idea?

343
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:39,109
I'm not capable enough, but I took a guess.

344
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,199
Feel free to say it.

345
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,620
Minting coins not only requires manpower,

346
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,359
but also copper ore, tin ore, water, and firewood.

347
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,459
The ore can be transported from elsewhere,

348
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:51,079
but water and firewood must be sufficient here.

349
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,649
Otherwise, it would be inconvenient and greatly increase the cost.

350
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:54,990
The cost will outweigh the gain.

351
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:59,429
Therefore, the mint must be in a lush forest with abundant water,

352
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:01,719
and it's convenient to get in and out.

353
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,969
After all, a large number of coins need to be sent out of the mountain.

354
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:09,030
They won't take a road like this.

355
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,669
You've said a lot. Where is this place?

356
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,829
I need to ask Miss Chu about this.

357
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,369
Me?

358
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:22,900
There are many places here with plenty of trees,

359
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,039
sufficient water, and a convenient road.

360
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,840
I don't know, either.

361
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,240
Are you making a wish?

362
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,160
I'm not.

363
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Childish.

364
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,899
I saw you and Xiao Jinli drinking and laughing on the roof

365
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,129
of the county office last night.

366
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,579
What were you talking about?

367
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,580
None of your business.

368
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:09,460
Did you agree to marry him?

369
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:15,360
Actually, if I think about it, Xiao Jinli is pretty good.

370
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,730
If I marry him, I'll be Commandery Prince An's sister-in-law.

371
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:24,560
Then no one would dare to talk nonsense to me.

372
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,199
You really think so?

373
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:30,060
You can't think this way. Xiao Jinli...

374
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,249
there is nothing good about Xiao Jinli.

375
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,059
He is stubborn and bad-tempered.

376
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,899
He wears the same clothes all day long.

377
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,329
He also has stinky socks on him.

378
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,329
You can't marry him.

379
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,850
You won't be happy if you marry him.

380
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,020
Then, who should I marry that will make me happy?

381
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,090
Me... Me.

382
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,009
You must be sick.

383
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:55,729
What's wrong with me? Consider me.

384
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,430
No.

385
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,630
Chu Chu.

386
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,749
Is there any place in the mountain

387
00:25:13,749 --> 00:25:16,229
with running water that does not flow into the villages,

388
00:25:16,229 --> 00:25:19,049
dense bamboo forests, and a road leading to

389
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,179
the busiest place down the mountain?

390
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,980
Running water that does not flow into the villages,

391
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,100
dense bamboo forests, and a road leading to the busiest place?

392
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,489
Minting coins requires a lot of sustained water.

393
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,730
So it must be running water.

394
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,319
If the sewage generated by minting coins

395
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:39,030
flows into the water source where people live,

396
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,989
it would be easily noticed.

397
00:25:40,989 --> 00:25:44,199
So the running water must flow to a place where no one lives,

398
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:47,230
like in this valley, to stay hidden for a long time.

399
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,899
Minting coins needs to burn wood.

400
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,959
Although bamboo is not the best fuel,

401
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:53,839
it's easy to cut down and it grows fast.

402
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:56,629
It's convenient and not easy to be noticed.

403
00:25:56,629 --> 00:25:59,519
As for the road leading to the busiest place,

404
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:01,419
because this place is sparsely populated,

405
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,249
no matter the coins are sent out in a small amount with more times

406
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,459
or in a large amount with fewer times,

407
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,119
it's still very easy to be noticed.

408
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,149
But if they blend in the crowd in disguise,

409
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,270
it would be much safer for them.

410
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,190
It makes sense.

411
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:19,629
When you put it like this, I think there is such a place.

412
00:26:19,629 --> 00:26:21,960
But that place is not a mint.

413
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,230
It's a kiln.

414
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:25,089
A kiln?

415
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,650
A place to produce porcelain.

416
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,909
That place is exactly the same as you described.

417
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:31,969
A kiln? Yeah.

418
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,180
It must be that kiln.

419
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,279
It's not an official kiln, right?

420
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:41,319
No. I can swear with my head.

421
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:44,570
There is no registered official kiln in Phoenix Mountain.

422
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,779
I know where that kiln is.

423
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,510
I'll take you there.

424
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,610
Thank you, Miss Chu.

425
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,170
Your Highness, please.

426
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,340
It's here.

427
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,779
Go. Hurry up!

428
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,840
Commandery Prince An. It looks like no one has been here for a long time.

429
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,259
How did it become like this?

430
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,469
I remember there was smoke coming up

431
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,210
when I went into the mountain in November last year.

432
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,999
There are no ruts on the ground and no footprints.

433
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:12,480
The yellow leaves of last winter are still here.

434
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,420
This place should have been abandoned for several months.

435
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:19,490
Even though this kiln is empty now,

436
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,480
I think there must be some clues here.

437
00:28:22,489 --> 00:28:28,179
I remember you mentioned in a case file you sent back to me

438
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,539
that every move of a person will leave a trace.

439
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,939
Those who destroy the remains

440
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,129
will also leave traces of the destruction.

441
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,370
There are always clues.

442
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,100
Jinyu.

443
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,450
Your Highness, please.

444
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,920
Watch your steps after you go inside.

445
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,559
Everything here is evidence.

446
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,681
Don't touch them.

447
00:29:36,681 --> 00:29:39,180
Yes, I got it.

448
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,699
It seems to be just a kiln.

449
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,230
Are the tools for minting coins and making porcelains the same?

450
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,340
It requires a furnace to melt the metal.

451
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:54,279
A kiln can't be used as a furnace.

452
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:56,999
In such a small place, people can't move at all

453
00:29:56,999 --> 00:29:58,929
if they put a furnace here.

454
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:01,689
Besides, you can see what's here at a glance.

455
00:30:01,689 --> 00:30:03,759
If they place the equipment for minting coins here,

456
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:06,860
it's easy to be spotted by the villagers when they come here.

457
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,449
Your Highness! It's empty here!

458
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,430
There is something wrong with this wall.

459
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,700
There are traces on the ground.

460
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,070
We should be able to move this wall.

461
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,260
It has opened.

462
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,599
Commandery Prince An is perceptive indeed.

463
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,440
There is something wrong with this kiln.

464
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,559
Jinli, please take some people and bring some torches here.

465
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:18,849
Let's go inside and take a look.

466
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,450
Okay.

467
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,260
Your Highness, are you okay?

468
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,400
I heard that it's a illness.

469
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,509
You will get sick when you go into a place without windows.

470
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:14,410
Are you...?

471
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,499
Don't worry. No matter what's inside,

472
00:32:17,499 --> 00:32:19,140
I'll be by your side.

473
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,159
What's wrong, Jinyu?

474
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,500
Commandery Prince An. Miss Chu.

475
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,430
Did you find anything?

476
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:29,609
Your Highness, why do you look so ill?

477
00:32:29,609 --> 00:32:31,559
It doesn't matter.

478
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:34,209
I'm just tired. I'll be fine after some rest.

479
00:32:34,209 --> 00:32:37,619
Take a break if you are tired. We have plenty of time.

480
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:40,860
It's okay. Let's go.

481
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,640
Be careful, Your Highness.

482
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,230
Your Highness!

483
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,040
Your Highness.

484
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:09,670
Your Highness, look.

485
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,650
Give it to me.

486
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:23,219
Your Highness, this is the place where they minted coins.

487
00:33:23,219 --> 00:33:26,700
There is a mint in the kiln.

488
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,370
Prefect Li.

489
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:36,680
Do you remember that Jing Yi asked a puzzling question yesterday?

490
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,479
Forgive me for being slow-witted.

491
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:42,340
You are saying...

492
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:47,289
He asked you why this group of bandits risked their lives

493
00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:50,000
to mint coins for such little profit.

494
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,150
Yes, I remembered it.

495
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:55,920
You also said we would know it after we find the mint

496
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,120
and ask the supervisor.

497
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:04,050
Your Highness, these bandits are all gone.

498
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,060
I'm afraid we won't be able to catch anyone.

499
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:09,690
Then there will be no way of finding out.

500
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,150
Not necessarily.

501
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:16,220
The profit they made is not that little as Jing Yi estimated.

502
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,329
Jing Yi misestimated the profit because he calculated it

503
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:23,040
according to the cost in a normal situation.

504
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,609
But if it's a local official who is in charge of the minting of coins,

505
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:31,030
it would be a totally different situation.

506
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,360
Every county office has labor expenses.

507
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,560
If the official slightly changes the account book,

508
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,120
the labor cost of minting coins can be paid by the county office.

509
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,750
By the same logic, the copper and tin used to mint coins

510
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:49,329
can also be paid by the county office by changing the account book.

511
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,749
This way, the biggest costs

512
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:55,120
were paid by the county office with the public money.

513
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,379
The rest doesn't cost much.

514
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,109
It's such a profitable business.

515
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,810
This is...

516
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:09,089
Well, is there anything wrong with my analysis?

517
00:35:09,089 --> 00:35:10,879
No, no.

518
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,359
I understand it all of a sudden and I'm enlightened

519
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,429
after hearing what you just said.

520
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:25,300
I just can't think of any official in Qianzhou who can be this bold.

521
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:28,359
This place is under the jurisdiction of Guanling County.

522
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,270
Could it be Magistrate Zheng Youde?

523
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,469
You forgot a little thing.

524
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,869
Guanling County is just a poor county.

525
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,850
They don't even have any money to hire more people.

526
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:49,960
Even if Zheng Youde wanted to do it, what excuses can he use

527
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,730
for such a large expenditure?

528
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:56,449
I'm slow-witted. I was in a hurry and I didn't think it through.

529
00:35:56,449 --> 00:35:58,750
Please forgive me.

530
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,839
It's not that you didn't think it through.

531
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,709
Guanling County is a hidden place indeed.

532
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:13,079
But its only disadvantage is the inconvenience to get in and out

533
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,240
caused by its concealment.

534
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,759
In order to send the fake coins out of Guanling County as soon as possible,

535
00:36:19,759 --> 00:36:24,919
five years ago, you allocated some money to build a bridge in Guanling County.

536
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,410
It was to provide convenience for the criminals,

537
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:34,429
but now everyone is praising it as a good deed.

538
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,639
That's ironic.

539
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,149
Well... Your Highness, please don't wrong me.

540
00:36:38,149 --> 00:36:40,269
I built the bridge for the good of the people here.

541
00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:42,590
There is no other intention.

542
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,270
Your Highness, take a look.

543
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:54,850
The wounds on Prefect Li's hands

544
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:57,730
fit these tools perfectly in terms of shape and size.

545
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,760
It's you who made the coin molds!

546
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:19,950
