2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,679
The eunuchs were reckless

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,229
and gave deliberate misrepresentations.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,820
They made up the rebellion of the Military Commissioner of Jiannan

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,170
so that twenty thousand loyal soldiers were slaughtered.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,599
My father wanted to vindicate them with his loyal soul.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,160
I'll certainly accomplish this mission.

8
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,679
I'm Li Zhang, Prefect of Qianzhou.

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,139
Greetings, Duke Chang.

10
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,260
Don't stand on ceremony, Prefect Li.

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,570
You had a long trip.

12
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,600
Did Commandery Prince An find out anything in Qianzhou?

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,790
Don't worry, Your Highness.

14
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,479
He found the illegal coins accidentally.

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,900
I've taken over the case.

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,309
I'll take care of everything.

17
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,430
Be very careful and don't give yourself away.

18
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,239
Your Highness, this is an official document from Chang'an.

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,479
When I arrived, I saw the posthouse official sorting and registering the documents.

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,020
So that he wouldn't take his time and hold you up,

21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,170
I urged him to register it, and I brought it to you immediately.

22
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,479
Thank you, Prefect Li.

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,499
You're flattering me, Your Highness.

24
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,130
[Han Ji, Minister of Justice]

25
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,799
Arrest Chu Chu?

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,439
Chu Chu?

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,590
Your Highness, do you mean Yun Yi's daughter?

28
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,479
You also know her?

29
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,549
Yes.

30
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,410
In an official order,

31
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:37,200
I was asked to help arrest this girl in Qianzhou and bring her back to Chang'an.

32
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,200
However, she stays with Xiao Jinyu every day.

33
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,050
I'm afraid...

34
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,170
What?

35
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,100
I'm afraid if we suddenly go arrest her

36
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,309
and have a head-on confrontation with Commandery Prince An,

37
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,460
it may hinder our big plan.

38
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,430
Let me think about it.

39
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,660
Well then, go to Guanling County with me tomorrow.

40
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,560
Yes, Your Highness. I'll be at your service.

41
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,339
All right. It's getting late.

42
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,009
Go back for some rest.

43
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,410
All right.

44
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:29,200
I don't think Li Zhang can outwit Xiao Jinyu.

45
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,600
I need a backup plan.

46
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:05,880
[The Imperial Coroner]

47
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,620
[Episode 22]

48
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,859
[Summon Military Commissioner Chen Ying to Chang'an with his troops.]

49
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,769
It's the secret imperial decree Emperor Wenzong issued.

50
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,699
Summoned by this decree,

51
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,780
Chen Ying took troops back to Chang'an to help Emperor Wenzong.

52
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,370
With this, can we reverse the case of the Military Commissioner of Jiannan?

53
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,400
It's Father's last wish

54
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,880
and it also concerns Miss Chu's life.

55
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,950
Once the truth is revealed,

56
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,699
there'll be a big dispute in the court.

57
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,310
We must be carefully prepared before reserving the case.

58
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,720
Like Father said, if we take one wrong step,

59
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,920
we'll implicate more innocent people.

60
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,320
Don't worry, Chu Chu.

61
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,820
I will vindicate your parents and prove your innocence.

62
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,900
Your Highness, I trust you.

63
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,570
I'll leave my father to you.

64
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,240
I don't care how you report to my father about what happened today.

65
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,630
But you must send this to him.

66
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,730
Vice Minister Jing, now that His Highness has learned

67
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,440
that you and Senior Jing send letters

68
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,540
as well as about our relationship,

69
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,970
why do you still send letters through me?

70
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,800
I'm not guarding against Commandery Prince An.

71
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,970
Who is it?

72
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,500
The real enemy.

73
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,549
You must be very careful.

74
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,949
Yes.

75
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,789
Vice Minister Jing,

76
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:26,340
I've executed nine subordinates of the Military Commissioner of Jiannan.

77
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,620
They all claimed they were innocent before they died.

78
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,820
But I never asked them

79
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,410
what exactly happened that year.

80
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,350
Even if you asked, they couldn't tell you much.

81
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,850
No one knew the secret truth, except for a few generals.

82
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,690
The more well-trained the soldiers are,

83
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,460
the more accustomed they are to taking orders.

84
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,740
I guess when General Chen Ying gave an order,

85
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,970
they followed him immediately.

86
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,629
They didn't know what exactly happened

87
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,749
even when you executed them.

88
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,340
So when they said they were innocent...

89
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,650
they were truly innocent.

90
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,480
Vice Minister Jing,

91
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,349
I know I'm not very talented or virtuous.

92
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,490
I don't dare to call myself a good official.

93
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:10,000
But I never expected that I alone have executed some loyal soldiers.

94
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:13,770
No matter how I'm punished,

95
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,279
I won't complain.

96
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,900
All right. A lot of people owe them.

97
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,150
I hope we can make it up a bit.

98
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,550
Go ahead.

99
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,959
Chu Chu, you're a coroner.

100
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,210
You got along with him for years

101
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,530
and you just inspected him.

102
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,920
You know all his wounds.

103
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,820
Isn't that right?

104
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,560
How badly was he wounded?

105
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,970
Why didn't he ever recover?

106
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,040
Five years ago, he was in his early forties.

107
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,169
How did he know he was dying?

108
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:11,190
Don't ask, Your Highness.

109
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,829
He didn't want you to know these things.

110
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:18,130
Chu Chu, he was my father.

111
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,980
Just like how much you want to know

112
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,389
what happened to your mother before she died,

113
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,500
I also want to know exactly how he knew...

114
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,160
that he was dying?

115
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,349
In his old notes,

116
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,349
he always said life was precious.

117
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,880
He poured scorn on people who killed themselves.

118
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,779
He wouldn't kill himself unless he had to.

119
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,780
Tell me, please.

120
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,700
There were many old wounds on his body that I didn't know of before.

121
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,540
But the wounds healed quickly.

122
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,280
His broken leg kept torturing him.

123
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,239
His leg was so badly wounded

124
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,410
that even his bones were injured.

125
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,339
You told me that

126
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,589
his leg was badly wounded,

127
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,610
but there was hope to cure it.

128
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,760
It was held up and didn't heal

129
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,200
simply because of delayed treatment.

130
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:27,120
But it could only stop him from walking.

131
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,220
Why did he die?

132
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,170
If he fell and was wounded, he wouldn't die.

133
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,680
But his leg was gashed.

134
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,800
He used to tell people that

135
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,900
he fell off a mountain and broke his leg.

136
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,639
He let no one check on it,

137
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,470
including the physicians or my family.

138
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,480
So... before I checked his leg today,

139
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,370
I believed he had really fallen and broken his leg.

140
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,610
Now I realize he didn't want others to know

141
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,830
his leg was gashed,

142
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,110
or someone might track him down.

143
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,830
So...  he tolerated it.

144
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,680
If bones are broken,

145
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,910
what's the difference between falling and being gashed?

146
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,980
There's a difference.

147
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,159
There's a wound closure for a fracture.
[Intact skin with fracture]

148
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,810
But when a man is gashed,

149
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,489
there's an open wound on the bone.
[Open and neat wound]

150
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,699
[Blade]
An open wound

151
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,200
would easily be infected

152
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,679
and cause disease on the bones.

153
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,120
Such a disease can hardly be removed.

154
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,740
Also, the Witch Doctor didn't allow a doctor to check on him.

155
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,809
He used his own medicine.

156
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,290
As time went by, the disease went into the bones

157
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,779
and then throughout his body.

158
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,369
[Disease invades the bones and then the entire body.]

159
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,680
By then he couldn't be cured.

160
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,700
How...

161
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,650
How did he feel?

162
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,849
I think he felt pain.

163
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,490
But the pain didn't last.

164
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,830
It happened from time to time.

165
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,379
It repeated unless it was cured.

166
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:23,090
When there was pain on unaffected bones,

167
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,690
he...

168
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,600
he knew he was dying.

169
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,249
He allowed no one to check on his wound

170
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,000
and he told no one about it.

171
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,119
So, all that time,

172
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,079
no one knew that he was suffering.

173
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,890
What are you doing?

174
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,799
General Zhou, you've got more fragrance on you.

175
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,520
You must have visited girls very recently.

176
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:46,930
You know, I thought of taking you with me when I went,

177
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,460
but I realized that you couldn't have fun with girls.

178
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,020
All right, I'll report it to Eunuch Qin.

179
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,840
He couldn't, either.

180
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,389
Can't you take a joke?

181
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,389
I'm not joking.

182
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,740
Eunuch Qin said

183
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,970
you should think about where you got the money

184
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,830
to pay for your happy hours with girls.

185
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,119
I know.

186
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,860
I went to Pingkang Residence for intel.

187
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,050
That's where all kinds of men visit.

188
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,119
It's a perfect place to get intel.

189
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,980
Men from Three Judicial Offices go there, too.

190
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,710
In such a good place, what intel did you get?

191
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,989
Time and luck are needed to gain some intel.

192
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,080
Luck?

193
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,559
I think it's your greatest luck

194
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,700
when Eunuch Qin hasn't killed you yet.

195
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,290
You'd better behave yourself.

196
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,200
Check out what Master asked you to do and report on your mission soon.

197
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,189
I understand.

198
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,679
Speaking of it,

199
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,149
His Majesty also cares about Duke Chang.

200
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,100
Why doesn't Eunuch make use of him and check the case?

201
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,710
- Who should be made use of?
- His Majesty.

202
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,929
- His Majesty?
-Yes.

203
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:57,439
What's in your mind? Rubbish?

204
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,100
Did you get your head caught in the door when you left home this morning?

205
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,999
Why are you so talkative today?

206
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,610
Just do what you're asked to.

207
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,640
Tell me. Is there any news from the Southwest?

208
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,500
Speaking of that, there's really something fishy with the Military Commissioner of Qianzhongdao.

209
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,869
I urged many times, but there's no reply yet.

210
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,760
But some of our men escorted Xue Rucheng to Qianzhou, didn't they?

211
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,490
As estimated, they have arrived in Qianzhou already.

212
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,960
- Xue Rucheng?
- Right.

213
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,420
Xiao Jinyu, Xiao Jinyu, look at you.

214
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,810
You hired a female coroner and ruined my plan.

215
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:00,450
Now she's a rebel's daughter.

216
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:05,809
When I catch her, you'll leave Qianzhou soon.

217
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,500
Grandfather.

218
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,340
Do you miss your mother?

219
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,050
Yes.

220
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:27,900
I'm thinking about why did my mother like my father and why did she marry him?

221
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,500
When she married him, she didn't expect what would happen, did she?

222
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,910
If she knew what would happen,

223
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,419
would she still want to marry him?

224
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,879
Silly girl, what are you imagining?

225
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,359
Your parents were a sweet couple.

226
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,819
After your father's family was ruined,

227
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,750
she didn't hate him.

228
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,240
Grandfather, how do you know that?

229
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,350
When your mother died, she was pregnant for eight months.

230
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,389
With you in her body,

231
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,880
she came all the way to Qianzhou along mountain roads.

232
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,660
If she hadn't protected you carefully,

233
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,099
you would have died.

234
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,800
If she hated your father,

235
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,030
before your father's family was ruined,

236
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,470
she would have aborted you.

237
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,880
She was beautiful and young.

238
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,659
Without the baby, she would easily marry someone else.

239
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,790
I inspected my mother's corpse.

240
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,490
Based on her pelvis, she didn't give birth before she had me.

241
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,270
I'm her first and her only child.

242
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,299
She escaped all the way here to give birth to me.

243
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,300
Maybe...

244
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,019
Maybe she really loved my father

245
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,660
and tried to keep his last family member

246
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,919
as the only connection with him.

247
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,549
The last family member?

248
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:40,640
Chu Chu, do you know anything about your father?

249
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,830
What happened to his family?

250
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,470
Why were you his last family member?

251
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,539
Nothing. I don't know anything.

252
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,429
I just...

253
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,129
I just guessed.

254
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:57,019
But I know my father must be a good man.

255
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,779
It's getting late.

256
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,729
I'll go make lunch.

257
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,330
Wait.

258
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,890
I have something to ask you.

259
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,700
I can tell that His Highness thinks highly of you.

260
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,580
He wants you to work for him.

261
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,369
But he's going back to Chang'an.

262
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,770
What's your plan?

263
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,270
I...

264
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,380
I haven't made up my mind yet.

265
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,029
I'm going to make lunch.

266
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,630
All right.

267
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,650
Father left such an important mission.

268
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,830
I'll accomplish it!

269
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,220
Your Highness, a message from Chang'an.

270
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,480
[Lord Xue came to arrest Chu Chu, under the command of His Majesty.]

271
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,600
Go ask General Xiao to take his soldiers to the Chu family.

272
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,739
Without my permission, let no one take anyone of the Chu family away from their house!

273
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,150
Yes!

274
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,380
[Guanling Yamen]

275
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,100
Sir, you had a long trip.

276
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,390
It's my honor to fulfill His Majesty's order.

277
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,200
Where's General Xiao?

278
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,389
He's away for some business.

279
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,530
He'll be back and see you later.

280
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,920
Magistrate Zheng.

281
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,029
Here.

282
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,909
Looks like I'll stay here for days.

283
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,959
It's my honor.

284
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,799
What do you need, My Lord?

285
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,259
Please find me a quiet place

286
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:04,029
so that His Highness and I can have a word alone.

287
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,800
All right. I'll find it immediately.

288
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,509
This way, Sir.

289
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,010
Come.

290
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,660
[Lord Xue came to arrest Chu Chu, under the command of His Majesty]

291
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,400
Sir, congratulations on becoming Minister of War.

292
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,029
His Majesty showed grace on me.

293
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:37,089
I don't know whether it's luck or a curse.

294
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,939
If I guess correctly,

295
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,520
you sent your brother away on purpose. Right?

296
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,959
Yes.

297
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,049
Sir, I don't dare to deceive you.

298
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:53,599
I've heard about what happened in the court.

299
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,450
Now that you know it,

300
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,389
I feel much relieved.

301
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,949
On my way here, I was thinking

302
00:21:00,949 --> 00:21:04,710
about how to tell you about this.

303
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,229
When you've already heard about it,

304
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,989
I'll get to the point.

305
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:12,699
Jinli can't marry Leng Yue.

306
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,199
You don't agree with this marriage?

307
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,219
His Majesty wants them to get married,

308
00:21:20,219 --> 00:21:23,869
not simply because he wants them to be a good couple.

309
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:27,739
Do Jinli and Leng Yue know about  it?

310
00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:30,050
I haven't told them yet.

311
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,099
I know it's hard for you.

312
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,839
Leng Yue's adored you since she was little.

313
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,859
It's quite difficult for you to tell her about that.

314
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:45,009
No, that's not it.

315
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:46,259
You got it wrong, Sir.

316
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:48,909
Leng Yue and I are only cousins.

317
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,070
We don't love each other.

318
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,989
I haven't told them about it,

319
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,199
because it was quite unexpected.

320
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,029
I doubt there's another reason for it.

321
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,199
Now that you suspect,

322
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,149
you must have guessed about it.

323
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,400
I guess that His Majesty wants them to get married

324
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,769
to restrain the military power of the Leng family.

325
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,300
Sir, they have garrisoned the Southwest for so many years.

326
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,600
I've never heard about their disloyalty.

327
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:23,380
Why does His Majesty suddenly want to restrain them?

328
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,920
Sir?

329
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,610
I don't know the details, either.

330
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:38,000
Senior Jing suggested to his His Majesty to allow Jinli to marry Leng Yue

331
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,159
so that Jinli could get back Leng Peishan's military power.

332
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,659
But the Leng family has settled in the Southwest for generations

333
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,090
and has been leading the troops.

334
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:50,489
As the head of the Leng family,

335
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,590
Leng Peishan wouldn't easily give up his military power.

336
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,979
As far as I see, you'd better go back to Chang'an quickly

337
00:22:56,979 --> 00:23:00,430
so that you can discuss with your mother

338
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,800
on how to reject the marriage.

339
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,490
There's another thing.

340
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:14,200
That's why I came all the way to see you before His Majesty orders them to get married.

341
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,800
- What's it, Sir?
- Tell me the truth.

342
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,499
When you checked on Feng Jie's case,

343
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,990
what did you exactly get?

344
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:27,439
Sir, why do you suddenly ask?

345
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,829
I didn't know it until I took over the Ministry of War.

346
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:34,239
Feng Jie made a summary when patrolling in the Southwest,

347
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,309
but it was missing when he went back to Chang'an.

348
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,759
No one knew what was recorded in it.

349
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,249
If Feng Jie was murdered,

350
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,159
the summary must be very important.

351
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,309
Now that you asked about Feng Jie,

352
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,989
you must have had a general conjecture

353
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,190
about what he recorded.

354
00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:00,549
I came all the way along the route Feng Jie patrolled

355
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:02,179
and got nothing useful.

356
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,849
If I keep moving forward,

357
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,389
I'll be reaching the military town where Leng Peishan is stationed.

358
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,900
I stayed with my brother these days,

359
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,600
but he didn't tell me there was anything wrong in the army.

360
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,680
Jinyu.

361
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,190
Sir, do you even suspect my brother?

362
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:24,029
I watched Jinli grow up.

363
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,109
I know what kind of person he is.

364
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:30,260
He's very upright, but not meticulous.

365
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,229
If someone makes use of him,

366
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,479
he may not know.

367
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,909
Well, I'm just guessing.

368
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,620
I hope I'm having groundless worry.

369
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:46,109
There seems to be trouble in Qianzhou.

370
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,500
In case Princess Xiping worries, you'd better go back to Chang'an early.

371
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,829
[Jiangshan Hall]

372
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:57,859
Your Majesty, I'd like to check the case in Qianzhou.

373
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,860
Your Majesty, it's a long trip to Qianzhou.

374
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,139
If we send men there,

375
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,189
it'll take a lot of days before they arrive.

376
00:25:07,189 --> 00:25:09,319
Also, no one in the Ministry of Revenue or the other three ministries

377
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,169
knows much about what happened in Qianzhou.

378
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:15,739
It's not a good plan to send them.

379
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,639
What do you think, Jing?

380
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,519
I remember Commandery Prince An is in Qianzhou now.

381
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,889
The illegal coin case is serious.

382
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,919
Our enemies will be alerted if we take any careless actions.

383
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,400
The wisest way is to let His Highness check the case, according to circumstances.

384
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,220
Senior Jing makes sense.

385
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,770
I agree with him, too.

386
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,869
You interrupted me,

387
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,700
so that I totally forgot Commandery Prince An was in Qianzhou.

388
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,170
Fine, then. Ask Hanlin Academy to draft the decree

389
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:56,529
that Commandery Prince An shall investigate the case, without fail.

390
00:25:56,529 --> 00:25:59,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

391
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,339
Who's that? Who dares to make trouble in my place?

392
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:12,380
Xiao Jinli?

393
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,749
What are you coming for?

394
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,799
I don't know.

395
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,029
You don't know?

396
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,599
You don't know why you came?

397
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,439
It's hard to explain.

398
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,599
Why do you always say that?

399
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,890
What can your tongue be used for?

400
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,359
Can't you say something sweet?

401
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,759
You can do nothing, but eat. Look at your fat waist.

402
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:32,340
Give it to me!

403
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,629
Well done, Xiao Jinli.

404
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,999
You even dare to grab my food?

405
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,200
I haven't dealt with you for how you bullied Jing Yi last time.

406
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,799
What does it concern you when I bullied Jing Yi?

407
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,400
Give it to me!

408
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,889
What's going on?

409
00:26:53,889 --> 00:26:56,349
- It's General Xiao.
- Give it to me!

410
00:26:56,349 --> 00:27:00,019
He and Miss Leng are fighting for a drumstick.

411
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:02,880
Why? There're more drumsticks.

412
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,109
Keep eating. I'll see if anyone marries you!

413
00:27:12,109 --> 00:27:14,100
This is none of your business!

414
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,430
Why are you fighting for a drumstick?

415
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,489
He asked for that!

416
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:30,009
Jing Yi, let me ask you. Isn't she fatter than she was two years ago?

417
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,479
Stop, Xiao Jinli.

418
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,069
Trust me. You're really asking for that.

419
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,240
Anyway, is the Chu family defended?

420
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,700
Come on. What exactly do you want?

421
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,029
[Lord Xue came to arrest Chu Chu, under the command of His Majesty.]

422
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,930
Wu Jiang wrote it.

423
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,199
All right, you're not fat.

424
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,599
Don't interrupt.

425
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,899
What exactly happened?

426
00:27:55,899 --> 00:27:57,839
Lord Xue came to arrest Chu Chu, under the command of His Majesty.

427
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,440
What?

428
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,339
Sir, do you come here personally

429
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,650
with another mission?

430
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,899
I didn't know Three Judicial Offices could get intel

431
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:18,580
as fast as the Jing family.

432
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,680
Sir, I heard

433
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,969
that ten men from the Imperial Army came to Qianzhou with you.

434
00:28:26,969 --> 00:28:29,809
I asked about them when I came,

435
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:32,350
but I was told that they didn't come here.

436
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,010
I also heard that

437
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:39,859
Prefect Li Zhang of Qianzhou also came here with you.

438
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,409
When you're talking to me,

439
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:48,170
he's on his way to arrest Chu Chu with the Imperial Amy, right?

440
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,399
Jinyu, I'm sure you knew that.

441
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,149
The female coroner you hired is a rebel's daughter.

442
00:28:57,149 --> 00:29:01,389
Prefect Li and I didn't mean to catch her without letting you know.

443
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:04,840
We simply wanted to keep you safe.

444
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:09,440
There's a lot of criticism about you.

445
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,929
But after all, you were deceived.

446
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,509
I don't think His Majesty will blame you for that.

447
00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:20,639
Sir, Chu Chu isn't a rebel's daughter.

448
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,340
She isn't?

449
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:27,099
But Han Ji was very sure when he told His Majesty about it.

450
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:30,710
Sir, I have irrefutable evidence.

451
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,270
Stop!

452
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,149
Isn't that Li Zhang?

453
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,850
Why is he coming?

454
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,929
Why do they stop me, General Xiao?

455
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:56,229
We have some dealings in business.

456
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:57,289
What?

457
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,850
Your subordinates can't even recognize me?

458
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,289
At the behest of His Majesty,

459
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,699
I come to arrest the rebel's daughter!

460
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,000
Whoever is irrelevant should leave!

461
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:14,749
Vice Minister Jing. Miss Leng. I've got urgent business to do.

462
00:30:14,749 --> 00:30:19,149
I can't play the game with you that you pretend to be Commandery Prince An.

463
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,409
The rebel's daughter?

464
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:34,009
Prefect Li, you must make it clear.

465
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:36,440
Who's the rebel's daughter?

466
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,360
She is. She's the rebel Yun Yi's daughter.

467
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,699
Miss, surrender yourself in case of being tortured!

468
00:30:48,699 --> 00:30:50,049
What nonsense are you talking about?

469
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,009
She's my granddaughter!

470
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,479
What Yun Yi? What rebel?

471
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:56,740
You're in the wrong place!

472
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,629
Sir, if you keep fighting,

473
00:30:59,629 --> 00:31:02,930
you'll be sorry.

474
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,080
Take her down!

475
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,000
- Be careful!
- Father!

476
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,240
Stop!

477
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,920
Chu Chu!

478
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,849
- Go away!
- Father!

479
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,799
Father!

480
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,500
Chu Chu!

481
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,289
Father!

482
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,659
Let go of me!

483
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,360
Chu Chu!

484
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,540
How dare you wound me!

485
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,109
Sorry, Lord Li, that was an accident.

486
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,979
You!

487
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,680
Stop!

488
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:32,649
Minister Xue!

489
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,080
Minister Xue! Your Highness!

490
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,859
Your Highness.

491
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,760
Chu Chu, are you all right?

492
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,339
Prefect Li, why were you fighting against Vice Minister Jing and General Xiao?

493
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:47,409
Minister Xue, I was trying to arrest the rebel's daughter,

494
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,929
but they wounded me!

495
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,430
Look.

496
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,799
Minister Xue, it wasn't our fault.

497
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,649
Prefect Li came here with these unidentified men

498
00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:01,619
and he had no certificate at all.

499
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:04,789
But we're guarding this place, under the command of His Highness.

500
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:06,629
We wouldn't let them break in.

501
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,230
You!

502
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:18,119
Why does Prefect Li have so many tiny scars on his hand?

503
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,779
Minister Xue! It's some misunderstanding.

504
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:24,629
Prefect Li, thank you for coming.

505
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,560
Now that His Highness has come,

506
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,779
we'll take care of the thing about the rebel's daughter.

507
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:34,100
Why don't you go back and take care of your wound?

508
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,599
Fine, then.

509
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,900
Minister Xue. Your Highness.

510
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,900
See you.

511
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,080
Go!

512
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,779
Leng Yue. Jing Yi. Guard here.

513
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:00,029
Yes.

514
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:03,310
Sir, come, please.

515
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,820
- Grandfather.
- We're all right.

516
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,920
Don't worry.

517
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,650
This is Prince Consort?

518
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,380
Yes.

519
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,840
It's a petition Father left before he died.

520
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,949
It was decoded with a reverse phonetic notation

521
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,079
according to two poems on the casket.

522
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:44,399
It revealed the truth of the rebellion of Military Commissioner Chen Ying.

523
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,020
When did he die?

524
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,500
Five years ago.

525
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,150
Sir.

526
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,930
Come on.

527
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:16,139
This is a very serious case where a lot of people are involved.

528
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,639
Once other officials know it,

529
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,509
I'm afraid there'll be another conflict between ministers and eunuchs.

530
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:24,289
We must have a perfect plan and we mustn't act rashly.

531
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,540
I understand.

532
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,270
Why do you keep his corpse here?

533
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,009
As you said, this is a serious case.

534
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,600
I don't trust anyone else.

535
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:43,439
Father was close to the Chu family before he died.

536
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:45,889
The Chu family are upright and kind,

537
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,499
and they all work as coroners.

538
00:35:47,499 --> 00:35:49,249
They know how to preserve corpses.

539
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:53,790
So, I keep my father's corpse here.

540
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,669
Sir, what do you think we should do?

541
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,599
Go back to Chang'an with me immediately

542
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,229
and report to His Majesty.

543
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,879
When the truth is revealed in the court,

544
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,210
Chu Chu can be exonerated from being a rebel's daughter.

545
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:14,879
Sir, I'm afraid we can't go back to Chang'an now.

546
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,100
You asked to come to Qianzhou to look for Prince Consort.

547
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,739
Now that you found him,

548
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:21,839
why do you still want to stay?

549
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,369
A relevant criminal is fleeing in Qianzhou.

550
00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:26,189
I must hunt him down

551
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,269
and make him a witness for this case.

552
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,959
- Who do you mean?
- Xu Rugui.

553
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:35,909
The criminal who is wanted across the nation?

554
00:36:35,909 --> 00:36:38,029
Do you know where he is?

555
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,229
Kind of.

556
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,599
As Jinyu asked,

557
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,060
I've sent some soldiers to guard all entrances and exits to Guanling County,

558
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:49,200
and sent other soldiers to search Phoenix Mountain secretly disguised as local people.

559
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,299
We haven't found him yet, but we found some traces.

560
00:36:52,299 --> 00:36:53,879
Phoenix Mountain?

561
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,159
It's a mountain within Guanling County.

562
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,959
Tomorrow morning, I'll go up the mountain with my brother and search for him together.

563
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:01,409
All right.

564
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:04,999
You must be very careful.

565
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,500
Yes.

566
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:14,789
Jinli, I have something to ask Commandery Prince An.

567
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,029
Tell me the truth.

568
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:28,440
When did you fall in love with Chu Chu?

569
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:43,990
