Timing and subtitles brought to you by The Imperial Coroners @ Viki.com

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,929
Xu Rugui used Lady Xu's hairpin

3
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,291
to lead me to discover the identities of Chu Chu's biological parents,

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,279
trying to damage the trust between Chu Chu and I.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,789
Whatever happens, I will find out the truth.

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,709
My mother was killed by the housekeeper of the Xu family

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,300
and Xu Rugui is my uncle.

8
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,939
Your Majesty, I've found out

9
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:47,469
that the rumor about Duke Chang these days

10
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:52,629
came from a brat doing chores in the imperial garden.

11
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,209
He was new in the palace

12
00:00:54,209 --> 00:00:57,379
and hasn't changed the vulgar habit he developed when he was out there.

13
00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:03,389
Somehow he got the nerve and made up some shadowy stories

14
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:06,409
about the late Duke Chang.

15
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:08,839
I've severely reprimanded his supervisor

16
00:01:08,839 --> 00:01:11,309
who teaches him about the rules.

17
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,669
Is it really a new minion who spread the rumors about

18
00:01:14,669 --> 00:01:17,019
the son of Emperor Wuzong in the capital?

19
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:17,909
Yes.

20
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,849
He is bold indeed.

21
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:25,079
He had a few drinks and dared to talk nonsense in the palace

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,669
which was heard by the bored servants and spread outside the palace.

23
00:01:30,669 --> 00:01:33,599
And everyone is talking about it.

24
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,509
But he is also timid indeed.

25
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,899
He was so scared that he had a heart attack and died

26
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,729
before I could bring him to you.

27
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,019
Did he die of fear?

28
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:45,420
Yes.

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,250
The rumors...

30
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,280
Are these just rumors?

31
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,649
Your Majesty, you know that the offspring of Emperor Wuzong

32
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:01,009
have been dead for a long time.

33
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:05,029
These words are just rumors.

34
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,149
If you want to stop these rumors as soon as possible,

35
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,779
I have a solution.

36
00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:13,739
But I'm afraid you need to sacrifice a little bit.

37
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,499
I don't know whether I should say it.

38
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:17,599
Just go ahead.

39
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,619
I think these people can be incited by the rumors

40
00:02:21,619 --> 00:02:25,760
because they have forgotten the fact that

41
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,169
that Emperor Wuzong's sons died a long time ago.

42
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:34,859
You only need to remind them and the rumors will naturally disappear.

43
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:38,269
Tell me how I should remind them.

44
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,729
Your Majesty, you can choose an auspicious day

45
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:46,040
and give posthumous names to the sons of Emperor Wuzong.

46
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,420
Posthumous names?

47
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,469
Good.

48
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,629
Only the dead will be given posthumous names.

49
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,549
You are showing your benevolence.

50
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,359
I believe no minister will object to it.

51
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,799
Those who are discussing Duke Chang in the court and the commonalty

52
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,369
will also deeply admire your generosity

53
00:03:08,369 --> 00:03:11,509
and become more loyal to serve you.

54
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,110
Good.

55
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,429
Order the academician to draft an edict now and ask

56
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:22,259
the Ministry of Rites and the imperial astronomer to get on it immediately.

57
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:23,639
Yes, Your Majesty.

58
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,569
Order Wu Jiang to enter the palace tomorrow.

59
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:27,139
I have something to ask him.

60
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:29,809
It has been a while since Commandery Prince An left Chang'an.

61
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,879
Why is there no news from him at all?

62
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,719
If Xiao Heng is really in the Southwest,

63
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,669
there is no way he would avoid his biological son.

64
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

65
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:11,179
[The Imperial Coroner]

66
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:16,140
[Episode 17]

67
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,390
Why did you ask about Duke Chang?

68
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,689
Do you still remember Yan Ming?

69
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,749
Yan Ming?

70
00:04:26,749 --> 00:04:29,299
You found a scroll at Yan Ming's place.

71
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,409
I told you that Yan Ming was looking for someone.

72
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,390
Was he looking for Duke Chang?

73
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,080
It's possible.

74
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,199
When Yan Ming was repairing a book,

75
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,289
he had a habit that an official would have.

76
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:43,479
When he met a deceased person

77
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:52,400
whose year of death or whereabouts are unknown, he would try to find it out through the clues from the old scrolls.

78
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,969
The ink on his scroll was still new.

79
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:58,449
It can be seen that he got interested in the late emperor's young son

80
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:00,219
whose year of death is unknown.

81
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:03,289
Did he suspect that Duke Chang was still alive?

82
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:05,719
Before I left Chang'an, I asked Wu Jiang

83
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,500
to secretly verify what's written in his manuscript.

84
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Hold on.  A nerd scribbled a few words and you took it seriously?

85
00:05:12,549 --> 00:05:13,759
You even verified it?

86
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,879
Yan Ming's deduction is not rigorous enough,

87
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,879
but it's not all unreasonable.

88
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,999
The three people Xu Rugui ordered to kill in Chang'an

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,019
are Lu Chuansheng, the Capital Liaison Representative in Qianzhou

90
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:25,819
responsible for the communication between Chang'an and Qianzhou;

91
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:29,439
Liu Yue, the head of the Ministry of Revenue in charge of coins minting in the Southwest;

92
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,020
and Feng Jie, the Minister of War

93
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,719
who just finished the inspection of the military affairs in the Southwest before he was killed.

94
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,740
He hadn't had time to report on the military inspection.

95
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,509
All of them are related to Qianzhou.

96
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,289
And Qianzhou was also granted to Duke Chang at that time.

97
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:50,700
At such a point, Yan Ming was murdered because of a scroll about looking into the whereabouts of Duke Chang.

98
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,659
So you are suspecting

99
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:56,909
that Duke Chang is behind these things related to Qianzhou?

100
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,739
He killed Yan Ming because he was afraid that someone would know he was alive.

101
00:06:01,739 --> 00:06:02,999
It doesn't make sense.

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,099
If he is behind it,

103
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:08,809
the dancing girl should have destroyed the scroll when she killed Yan Ming.

104
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:10,229
Why would she hide it?

105
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,169
- There is another possibility.
- What possibility?

106
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:13,679
He killed Yan Ming,

107
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:16,199
not because he is afraid that people will know he is alive,

108
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,180
but because he wants people to know that he is alive.

109
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,849
Master.

110
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:31,899
There is one thing I can't figure out.

111
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:35,940
Why are you protecting that brat who took poison and committed suicide?

112
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,409
You think I'm protecting him?

113
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:40,919
Of course.

114
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,039
He must have committed suicide by taking poison

115
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,789
and there is someone behind it.

116
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,819
This Antique Store might be the clue.

117
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:55,599
But you didn't mention a word about it to the emperor.

118
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,509
Aren't you protecting him?

119
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,910
You are short-sighted.

120
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,509
I'm not protecting him,

121
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,890
I'm protecting us.

122
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:10,320
I'm foolish, please enlighten me.

123
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:18,480
The emperor asked us to look into this,

124
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,299
do you think he really wants to know the truth?

125
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:25,249
He was just testing us.

126
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:30,269
When the son of the late emperor was dying, we were by his side.

127
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,139
He suspects that we are behind it.

128
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,449
I have to solve it in this way to finish our job.

129
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:44,210
Master, you are wise indeed.

130
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:55,340
Mingde, let me tell you something from my heart.

131
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,779
Stop being that glib.

132
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:00,500
Try to be cleverer.

133
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,639
The channels of communication between Qianzhou and Chang'an court were cut off.

134
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,659
A large number of copper coins were minted.

135
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,300
The news about military affairs in the Southwest was strictly prevented from being reported to the court.

136
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,199
If there is one person behind all these things,

137
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,969
what do you think this person is up to?

138
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:18,220
What?

139
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,719
To plot a rebellion!

140
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,109
That's right.

141
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,159
Rebels of all dynasties want to be the ruler in the end.

142
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,319
But a dead person can't ascend the throne.

143
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,159
No one will support a dead man to be an emperor.

144
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,029
Therefore, if he wants to ascend to the throne in the name of Duke Chang,

145
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:36,999
he must bring Duke Chang back to life first.

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,549
You mean he killed Yan Ming

147
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,179
because he wanted you to discover the scroll

148
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,179
and find out Yan Ming was killed

149
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:48,319
because of his conclusion that Duke Chang is still alive,

150
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,079
so as to whip up public opinion

151
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,759
and then he can rebel in the name of Duke Chang?

152
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,099
That's why I've been trying to contain the news.

153
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:57,190
But I got news from Wu Jiang

154
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,349
that there are rumors in Chang'an about Duke Chang being alive.

155
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,609
I guess he realized that I'm not being used by him,

156
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:07,450
that's why he has to use the dumbest way to spread rumors.

157
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,489
There is no evidence but rumors.

158
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:11,549
He can't make any waves.

159
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,339
I'm not worried that he can make any waves with the rumors.

160
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,909
But I'm afraid he is so eager to spread the rumors

161
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:21,179
because everything is ready and he only needs a chance to do it.

162
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:24,419
If that's the case, we have to find him quickly.

163
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:26,909
He caused so many messes in Qianzhou.

164
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,569
Maybe he is hiding in Qianzhou.

165
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,809
This is too important to rush into.

166
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:32,419
Right now, Qianzhou is in such a mess.

167
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:33,789
A lot of things happened.

168
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,609
But these things are connected and interlocked.

169
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:42,330
If we can pull a thread from it, everything will be clear then.

170
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,709
Duke Chang is the trueborn son of the late emperor.

171
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,659
The emperor now is the uncle of the late emperor.

172
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:49,829
If Duke Chang is still alive and you find him,

173
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:51,859
it's fine if he is behind these things.

174
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:54,420
But if he is innocent,

175
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,149
how should the emperor deal with it?

176
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,909
That's exactly why I didn't tell you about it.

177
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,909
Weren't you blaming me for not taking you to handle those dangerous affairs?

178
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,639
I do have a selfish motive.

179
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,540
What?

180
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,959
If anything happens to me,

181
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,149
you are the only one I can entrust with the posthumous affairs.

182
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:16,540
And only you can coax my mother and my brother.

183
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,339
Your Highness.

184
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:22,109
My original intention of coming to the Three Judicial Offices was to be a rakish young master

185
00:10:22,109 --> 00:10:26,529
with my father and my brother's official authority.

186
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:28,959
How can it turn out like this?

187
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,730
You worked for it.

188
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,580
Fine. I deserve it.

189
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,279
What should we do to Xu Rugui?

190
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,339
Bring him back to the county office or send him to the Prefect's Mansion?

191
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,779
- Keep him here for now.
- Keep him here?

192
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,079
He just killed the father of the Deputy Magistrate, Tan Gui.

193
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,799
Keeping him in the county office may cause trouble.

194
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,979
But if we skip the magistrate and send him to Li Zhang,

195
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:54,100
it will also bring troubles if Li Zhang looks into it.

196
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,600
Your Highness,

197
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,050
you are afraid that Xu Rugui will tell others about Chu Chu's background. Right?

198
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,179
It has been our speculation and Xu Rugui's side of the story so far.

199
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:10,900
Before we have any conclusive evidence, don't bring this up to anyone.

200
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,639
Your Highness, you are going to suffer.

201
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,140
What?

202
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,680
You have someone inside of you.

203
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,449
All the prisoners who have not been arrested in Tang are all here.

204
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:27,419
Of course, I have people inside.

205
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:29,199
Cut it out.

206
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:33,030
Your enemies in the court include the discontented officials of the Three Judicial Offices,

207
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,999
the incompetent magistrates, and those eunuchs like Qin Luan.

208
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,029
Do they ever stop picking on you together?

209
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,789
Have you ever been so pissed off by them?

210
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,029
It's not the time that I brought trouble to you,

211
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,189
when have you been so angry with me?

212
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,929
It's such an important clue.

213
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:50,080
You must consider it carefully.

214
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,150
By the way, I brought this for you.

215
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,979
If you won't use it as evidence,

216
00:11:57,979 --> 00:12:00,880
then give it to Chu Chu as a keepsake.

217
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,540
Father, I want to ask you something.

218
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,770
What are you panicked about?

219
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,279
When Chu Chu's mother died,

220
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,779
did she die at the place of Chu Chu's uncle?

221
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:27,959
Yes.

222
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,519
Her brother is Chu Chu's uncle.

223
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,469
Have you met Chu Chu's uncle?

224
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,909
Yes.

225
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,079
Can you recognize him now?

226
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,950
Now? Where?

227
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,750
Maybe...

228
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,589
Did he come back to Guanling County?

229
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:52,129
Father, maybe he is locked inside our woodshed.

230
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,649
What? The man locked inside the woodshed is Chu Chu's uncle?

231
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,049
When they brought him here, his head was covered.

232
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:07,740
I was worried about Chu Chu

233
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,950
and didn't pay much attention to that man.

234
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,359
Yeah. They also said that there is one thing concerning Chu Chu's life.

235
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:18,440
- Concerning her life?
- What is it?

236
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,220
They spoke vaguely and I didn't hear clearly.

237
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,149
Father, what should we do?

238
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,789
Do what?

239
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,029
You are not sure about anything yet. Don't be in such a hurry.

240
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:32,699
I mean, Father. Are you going to let her die just because she is not your biological daughter?

241
00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:33,959
What nonsense are you talking about?

242
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,860
I'm telling the truth.

243
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,910
Xu Zongfang?

244
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,909
Thank you.

245
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,519
Mr. Chu, why are you still up so late?

246
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,229
I worked late.

247
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:03,399
I saw the light here and I'm here to bring you a pot of tea.

248
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,100
Give me the tea.

249
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,469
Thank you, Mr. Chu The dew is heavy in the late night.

250
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,750
Please go back and rest earlier.

251
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,810
I want to go inside and get something.

252
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,009
Mr. Chu, please.

253
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:23,610
Thanks.

254
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,129
Is he the bandit who kidnapped Chu Chu?

255
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:53,519
Yes, Mr. Chu. He is very dangerous.

256
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,060
You'd better go back to your room.

257
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,510
All right.

258
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,660
Father, how was it?

259
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,439
They covered his face and gagged his mouth. I can't tell.

260
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:19,789
All right, let's leave it to tomorrow.

261
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,950
- Father...
- That's it.

262
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:39,879
Everyone in this world will be unable to speak or move one day.

263
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,709
Our Chu family is to say out loud

264
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,859
what they want to say but cannot say.

265
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:50,029
Grandpa, can you hear the dead?

266
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:55,329
I don't hear them I see them.

267
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,659
Why can't I see them?

268
00:15:57,659 --> 00:15:59,209
Do you also want to see them?

269
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,610
Yes.

270
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,170
Good.

271
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,800
Grandpa.

272
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,469
I'm here to see if you are getting better.

273
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,519
What are you busy with early in the morning?

274
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,009
The room is too messy. I'm tidying it up.

275
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:21,029
Father always said the room is too messy to be a girl's room.

276
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,029
How does it not look like a girl's room?

277
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,759
If it's neat and clean, it won't be my Chu Chu's style.

278
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,090
Grandpa, have a seat.

279
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,379
Grandpa, it was my fault yesterday.

280
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:34,569
I made you worry about me.

281
00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:38,519
You are like a coroner working for a high official now.

282
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,369
You speak like a grown-up and you know the etiquette now.

283
00:16:41,369 --> 00:16:44,999
When you were at home before, I always saw you as a kid.

284
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,589
I thought a girl wouldn't get into the county office.

285
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:54,089
So I didn't give you any serious lessons.

286
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:58,569
Now it turns out that I was short-sighted.

287
00:16:58,569 --> 00:17:01,449
Grandpa, why are you saying this suddenly?

288
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:03,519
You will always be a member of the Chu family.

289
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,589
I promise you.

290
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,819
Tell me the truth.

291
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:08,879
Don't you trust me anymore?

292
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,880
Of course, I trust you.

293
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,369
Even you trust me, you still can't feel at ease.

294
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,729
I understand.

295
00:17:16,729 --> 00:17:20,349
A verbal promise doesn't count.

296
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,819
A coroner needs to write a report for the autopsy.

297
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:25,899
An official needs the case file to settle a lawsuit.

298
00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:30,159
And it also needs evidence to proves that you are the daughter of the Chu family.

299
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:32,949
This is the genealogy of the Chu family.

300
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:36,449
By the ordinary rules, women can't be written on it.

301
00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:37,829
But I'll make the decision this time.

302
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,829
If you are willing to be the child of the Chu family,

303
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,410
I'll write you in the genealogy.

304
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:48,499
In the future, no one can say that you are not a child of the Chu family.

305
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,789
Grandpa.

306
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:54,999
What are you doing? Get up.

307
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,279
Grandpa, I'm ungrateful.

308
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,009
I have a favor to ask you. Promise me you will say yes.

309
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:01,919
Get up first before you tell me.

310
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,049
Grandpa, just let me finish it.

311
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,650
Otherwise, you will think I'm being childish even if I say it.

312
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,259
Fine. I promise you. You can tell me now.

313
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:12,799
I don't expect my name to be written in the genealogy.

314
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,279
I only need you to promise me that no matter who my father is,

315
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,209
you must bury me beside my mother if I die one day.

316
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:25,279
When you have time, remember to visit me with my father and my brother.

317
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:27,509
What silly words are you talking about?

318
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,409
Grandpa, I'm serious.

319
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,100
Jinyu, do you hear that?

320
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,959
Please, don't despise me because of my background at that time.

321
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,959
If it's inconvenient for you, I don't need any offering or joss stick.

322
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,599
Just come and visit me.

323
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,390
I want to know if you are doing well.

324
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:50,660
I'm afraid... I'm afraid I won't be able to see you again.

325
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:55,330
Why do I feel like Miss Chu is preparing for her death?

326
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,190
Are you still thinking about Father?

327
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,779
Did you tell Jing Yi about what happened in your father's mansion?

328
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:06,180
No.

329
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,089
But he is clever enough.

330
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:11,059
I think he probably knows what happened.

331
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:13,229
I'm not worried whether he knows it or not.

332
00:19:13,229 --> 00:19:18,409
I'm just worried he will tell the people in the palace about Chu Chu.

333
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,580
About Miss Chu?

334
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,749
Chu Chu.

335
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:43,729
Your Highness?

336
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,430
Have a seat.

337
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,659
Why did you get up so early? You should sleep more.

338
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:57,709
I... I can't sleep.

339
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,609
- Your Highness, is there anything you want to say but you can't say?
- Yes.

340
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:05,080
Is it about the case?

341
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,209
Kind of. How about you?

342
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,700
Me, too.

343
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,719
That's why you are here washing the stones?

344
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:19,880
No, I'm going to grill the mushrooms.

345
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,689
When there was something I wanted to say but couldn't say,

346
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,579
I would put it in the vegetables and eat the dish after I cooked it.

347
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:27,939
Then I don't need to think about it.

348
00:20:27,939 --> 00:20:31,060
I don't know if it will work this time.

349
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,639
Well, I'll eat with you after you cook it.

350
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,109
It's better than eating alone.

351
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,920
Your Highness, it's nice to be your coroner.

352
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,240
I...

353
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,759
What's this?

354
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:55,290
Your Highness, what's wrong?

355
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,189
These stones seem to be glowing.

356
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,739
These are just ordinary stones.

357
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:05,860
There are a lot of stones like this right here.

358
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,209
I remember Witch Doctor said

359
00:21:09,209 --> 00:21:14,019
that there is something like spar inside these stones. I don't quite understand.

360
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:16,969
Anyway, these stones seem to glow when being illuminated by the light.

361
00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:18,710
It's very beautiful.

362
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,710
Light?

363
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,619
Lord!

364
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:35,199
Damn! You scared me.

365
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:37,540
Can't you keep your voice down?

366
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,409
I almost ruined the koi sculpture.

367
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:40,899
What's the fuss about?

368
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,489
There is a letter from Guanling County

369
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:46,299
that they found the traces of a fugitive wanted by the court, Xu Rugui.

370
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:51,089
Give the order immediately and catch the wanted criminal now!

371
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:52,229
Yes!

372
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,730
Hold on.

373
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,699
Is Commandery Prince An still in Pingle Town?

374
00:21:56,699 --> 00:21:57,849
Yes.

375
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,469
I also heard that he dug up a woman's grave.

376
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,170
Dug...?

377
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,589
Didn't he come to find his father?

378
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,999
Why did he dig a woman's grave?

379
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,470
Does he want to get a dead stepmother for his dead father?

380
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,210
That's funny, My Lord.

381
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,169
By the way, My Lord.

382
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:23,040
You don't need to worry about

383
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,009
the investigation into minting coins privately.

384
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:26,179
Why is that?

385
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,089
The man drinking with you

386
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:32,409
and Magistrate Zheng in the County Office of Guanling on that day was not Commandery Prince An.

387
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,529
- Who was that person then?
- That was the Vice Minister of the Court of Judicial Review, Jing Yi.

388
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:39,879
Jing Yi?

389
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,679
Vice Minister Jing is just an idle young master.

390
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,169
He rarely does anything serious.

391
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:46,579
When you had drinks on that day,

392
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:50,549
I guess he was just making fun of you and Magistrate Zheng.

393
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,719
What do you know?

394
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,989
There must be a plan.

395
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,209
The Jing family is a family of foxes.

396
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,509
They are best at finding out the truth through expressions and voices.

397
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:05,379
I dealt with Jing Yi in the way I should deal with Commandery Prince An.

398
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,879
It's wrong.

399
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,180
It's all wrong.

400
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,330
It's all wrong!

401
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:20,479
They messed with me must have been because they wanted to step in the coin minting thing.

402
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,639
Keep an eye on Guanling County.

403
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,919
Let me know if you have any news!

404
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,420
Yes!

405
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,940
[Princess Xiping's Mansion]

406
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,699
Greetings to Your Grace.

407
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:45,659
You may rise.

408
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:47,399
Thank you, Your Grace.

409
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,679
You came early this morning.

410
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,189
Did anything happen to Jinyu?

411
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,350
Your Grace, rest assured.

412
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,369
Commandery Prince An and General Xiao are doing well.

413
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:57,300
There is something His Highness asked me to show you.

414
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,869
He is in a hurry so I came in early in the morning.

415
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:03,159
Please forgive me for disturbing your rest.

416
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,989
What is it? Bring it to me.

417
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:06,590
Yes.

418
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,260
[To Mother]

419
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,369
His Highness is investigating a case.

420
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:23,659
This hairpin belongs to a person involved in the case.

421
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,800
His Highness hopes that he can find out who this person involved is through this hairpin.

422
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,829
He said the owner of this hairpin should be a person of high status.

423
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,560
Maybe you can recognize it.

424
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,010
It looks familiar.

425
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,580
I got it.

426
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,779
This was a gift from my mother to Madam Jing.

427
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:54,759
You mean the wife of Senior Jing?

428
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,030
Yes, it's her.

429
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,560
Master.

430
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,160
Come in.

431
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,020
There is an urgent letter from Qianzhou.

432
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,720
[To Father]

433
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,150
Well...

434
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,630
Is it a hairpin?

435
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,860
It looks so familiar.

436
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,960
I have the exact same hairpin.

437
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,229
- Really?
- Yes.

438
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,159
I remember it.

439
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,929
When we got married, Princess Xiping's mother gave me a pair of hairpins.

440
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:40,779
I kept one by myself and gave the other one to someone else.

441
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:42,480
Wait.

442
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,610
Look!  Do they look the same?

443
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,159
This is the style of young people.

444
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,490
I haven't worn it for years.

445
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:05,410
Do you remember whom you gave this hairpin to?

446
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,349
It's been a long time.

447
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,759
I can't remember.

448
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,429
But I have a record of the things I gave away.

449
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,930
I'll tell you after I check it.

450
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:20,360
Go to find the housekeeper and tell him

451
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,799
that I got slightly sick last night

452
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,169
and I'll ask for leave for the morning court.

453
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:27,450
You are not going to the court today?

454
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,759
Where are you going?

455
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,699
We have something to do. We will be back soon.

456
00:26:49,699 --> 00:26:51,799
No, you can go anywhere you want.

457
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,800
But Chu Chu must stay.

458
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,439
Missy, you haven't recovered yet. Take the medicine and get some good rest at home.

459
00:26:58,439 --> 00:27:00,209
Brother, I'm recovered. I'm fine.

460
00:27:00,209 --> 00:27:01,509
No, I said no.

461
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:02,980
Stay at home. You are not allowed to go anywhere.

462
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,059
- We have a very important thing to do.
- I don't care how important it is.

463
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:06,459
Come back with me.

464
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,160
Let her go!

465
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,670
- She is my sister...!
- She is a coroner of the Three Judicial Offices!

466
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,849
I'm going to take her out to handle a case.

467
00:27:17,849 --> 00:27:19,129
You are also a public servant.

468
00:27:19,129 --> 00:27:21,969
You should know what the crime is to obstruct your superior's work.

469
00:27:21,969 --> 00:27:24,649
It's very cloudy now. What if it rains?

470
00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:28,459
Well, does the coroner In Guanling County only go out to work on sunny days?

471
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,539
- You...!
- Brother, I said I'm fine. Just let me go.

472
00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:33,709
I'm just like you.

473
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,879
We are both coroners working for the government.

474
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,229
When you were working, no matter what happened,

475
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:41,129
as long as Magistrate Zheng asked you to go to the county office, you never hesitated.

476
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:42,719
Why are you stopping me now?

477
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:44,589
I am also a coroner just like you.

478
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,890
Commandery Prince An asked me to work, I will go no matter what happens.

479
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,629
Rest assured.

480
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:52,679
Since she is leaving with me, I will take good care of her.

481
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,509
What happened yesterday won't happen again.

482
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,799
I can't rest assured.

483
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,230
It will be too late if what happened yesterday happens again!

484
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,799
Let me ask you.

485
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,609
Where exactly are you taking Chu Chu to?

486
00:28:02,609 --> 00:28:05,539
Why didn't I hear that there was a homicide in the county?

487
00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:07,799
The homicide in the county should be handled by the county office.

488
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,709
My work is beyond the control of the county office.

489
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,009
Don't follow us secretly.

490
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:15,590
Otherwise, I will handle it according to the official principles.

491
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:20,689
You can try it if you are not afraid of losing the qualification of a coroner.

492
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,399
Let's go.

493
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,900
Brother, I'll be back in a while.

494
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,159
Your Highness, don't be angry.

495
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,489
Don't harm your health because of it.

496
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:46,589
I'm not angry.

497
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,909
My brother isn't usually like that.

498
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:49,799
I don't know what's wrong with him today.

499
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,360
I guess he was scared by what happened yesterday.

500
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,489
Don't worry. I'm not angry.

501
00:28:57,489 --> 00:29:00,590
I said those words because I don't want him to follow us.

502
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:05,409
Didn't you promise my father that you will keep the secret for him?

503
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,300
If he follows us, it will be inconvenient for us to talk.

504
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,050
You're not angry...

505
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,349
General Xiao, is he really not angry?

506
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:18,270
Since he said it, just take it.

507
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,980
All right.

508
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,590
What a stubborn man.

509
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,350
Grandpa, are you going to send food to Xu...

510
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,429
Send food to that bandit?

511
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,899
Your father went to the county office to work.

512
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,510
It's time for a meal.

513
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,289
I'll send the food to him.

514
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:43,719
Although he is a bad person and he hurt Chu, we still can't starve him.

515
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:47,249
He committed a crime and he will be punished according to the law.

516
00:29:47,249 --> 00:29:49,829
Grandpa, let me do it.

517
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,619
He is dangerous.

518
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,699
I can handle such a small thing.

519
00:29:53,699 --> 00:29:55,729
Go and do what you should do.

520
00:29:55,729 --> 00:29:58,589
Grandpa, I also need to go there and pick up a few things.

521
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,290
Let me do it.

522
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,829
Tell the two guards that their meal is on the table.

523
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,429
Ask them to eat it when they have time. Don't let the food get cold.

524
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:09,900
Got it. Go back to your room.

525
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,939
Sirs, it has been hard for you.

526
00:30:20,939 --> 00:30:22,199
I'm here to bring him some food.

527
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:23,289
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

528
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:24,499
Your meal is also ready.

529
00:30:24,499 --> 00:30:26,129
It's in the kitchen.

530
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,349
Hurry up and have a bite.

531
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,449
We can't. This person is really dangerous.

532
00:30:29,449 --> 00:30:30,999
We can take turns to eat.

533
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,109
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

534
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,040
I won't untie him. He can't run away.

535
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,969
What's more, this kitchen is so close to here.

536
00:30:35,969 --> 00:30:38,180
I'll call you if he runs away.

537
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,900
Commandery Prince An just left with Chu Chu and that general

538
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,639
to investigate some case.

539
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,069
I'm afraid they will send someone back and ask you to go with them.

540
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,229
It's hard to do your job well when you are starving.

541
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:53,700
I can't afford the punishment if they blame me.

542
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,570
I'm a little hungry.

543
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,799
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

544
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,439
- We will be back soon.
- Okay.

545
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:03,329
- Mr. Chu, be careful.
- Got it. Go ahead.

546
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,880
Please.

547
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,279
I want to ask you something.

548
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,069
I'll take out the cloth from your mouth.

549
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,870
Don't shout.

550
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,160
Let me ask you.

551
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,630
Are you Xu Zongfang?

552
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,879
You must be Chu He.

553
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,199
- How do you know that?
- Don't worry about how I know that.

554
00:31:56,199 --> 00:31:57,759
Hurry, untie the rope for me.

555
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,159
Chu Chu will be dead later.

556
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,159
What are you saying?

557
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,159
You just said that Xiao Jinyu and his brother took Chu Chu away.

558
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,300
They are going to kill Chu Chu.

559
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:10,310
But you are the one who almost killed Chu Chu yesterday!

560
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,059
You are killing me.

561
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:14,469
Since you came here to ask me if I am Xu Zongfang,

562
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:18,229
it means you know that I am Chu Chu's uncle. Right?

563
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:21,780
I was trying to take her away to save her.

564
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,039
Don't talk nonsense.

565
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,740
No one would...

566
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,469
No one would save a person in that way.

567
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,949
Didn't Chu Chu tell you that her biological father, Yun Yi,

568
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,799
is a criminal who rebelled with the Military Commissioner of Jiannan

569
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,279
and killed the father of Xiao Jinyu and Xiao Jinli?

570
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,500
Yesterday they opened the coffin of Chu Chu's biological mother, which is my sister.

571
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,189
They must have known the identity of Chu Chu's biological father.

572
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:48,730
I think they are going to retaliate against Chu Chu and kill her!

573
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:51,349
Well, I'll go and find them.

574
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,589
Don't!

575
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,519
Chu He, these two brothers are highly powerful

576
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,919
and they have soldiers in hand.

577
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,010
If you go now, you are taking down the whole Chu family!

578
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,919
I'll do it. Let me go now.

579
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,559
I'm Chu Chu's uncle.

580
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,809
I failed Chu Chu and her mother at that time.

581
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:12,420
But right now, I will protect her with my life.

582
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,529
What are you waiting for?

583
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:17,030
It will be too late if you don't untie me now.

584
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,400
Let's take the food back and eat lest anything should happen.

585
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,540
I'll go back, too.

586
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:43,179
Are you sure you can save Chu Chu?

587
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:44,880
Of course.

588
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,180
Hurry up.

589
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,829
Well... You two finished your meal so fast.

590
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,939
I think we should eat here.

591
00:33:59,939 --> 00:34:01,559
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

592
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,880
You can leave him to us now.

593
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,829
Okay, I'll leave.

594
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,639
Call me if you need anything.

595
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,640
Okay, thank you.

596
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,390
General! Your Highness!

597
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:43,759
Has anyone been here?

598
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,080
No one has been here.

599
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,150
Brother, give it to me.

600
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,869
Keep watch at the door. Don't let anyone approach.

601
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:54,500
Rest assured.

602
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,319
Chu Chu, close the door.

603
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,720
Okay.

604
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,519
Your Highness, why do you only place these four chess pieces?

605
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:29,529
I played twice with my elder brother and I played once with Jing Yi.

606
00:35:29,529 --> 00:35:31,089
Every time at the end of the game,

607
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:33,989
there would always be these four chess pieces in these four positions.

608
00:35:33,989 --> 00:35:36,519
Is there anything special about these four positions?

609
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,189
I haven't figured it out yet.

610
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:42,149
But when I saw those illuminated stones, these chess pieces,

611
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:46,300
and the layout of this room, I still feel that something is missing,

612
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,740
The layout of this room?

613
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:58,469
These were painted by Witch Doctor.

614
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,099
Does he like painting a lot?

615
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:02,629
He didn't like painting that much before.

616
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,469
But during the time before he left,

617
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,699
he just somehow started to like painting.

618
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:09,509
He didn't paint anything else but mountains and trees.

619
00:36:09,509 --> 00:36:12,930
These paintings are all scenes of Guanling County

620
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,949
The mountain is Phoenix Mountain.

621
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,390
The water is Yong'an River.

622
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,170
Light...

623
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,460
Light...

624
