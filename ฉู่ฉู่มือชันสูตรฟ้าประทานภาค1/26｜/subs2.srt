Li Zhang illegally made coin molds and minted coins.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,920
He used the mint as bait, trying to kill us.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,990
Fortunately, Chu Chu's astuteness saved me.

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,950
Chu Chu, I will never give you up.

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,200
Please, don't up on me.

7
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,480
Go.

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,049
We got Xu Rugui! Withdraw! Withdraw!

[Guanling County Office]

12
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,379
It's not easy to investigate the illegal minting of coins,

13
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,539
but now you have the right to act at your discretion in Qianzhou.

14
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,290
It's much more convenient now.

15
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,009
My father got you the authority without any trace.

16
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:07,929
I almost didn't realize it.

17
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:12,849
But, Your Highness, my father put a lot of thought to protecting us.

18
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:14,979
This is not a good sign.

19
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,209
That's right. Even Senior Jing is so careful about this,

20
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:22,529
it can be seen that the picture doesn't look good in Chang'an.

21
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:24,410
I'm afraid it's going to be harder

22
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,129
than we estimated to go back to Chang'an and redress the case.

23
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,099
Now, Xu Rugui is on his way back to Chang'an with Mr. Xue.

24
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,139
If Senior Jing can make good use of him,

25
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,690
maybe he can suppress Qin Luan for a while.

26
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,749
Rest assured. The first person to know about this must be my father.

27
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,779
I've sent a message to him as you told me.

28
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,540
With him being in Chang'an, I think they can't make any waves.

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,439
Leng Yue, did you get any reply to the previous letter?

30
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,920
Your Highness, I'm going to leave first.

31
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,160
Not yet.

32
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,600
Then stay in the mansion today.

33
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,909
It should be about the right time.

34
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,459
Greetings to Your Highness!

35
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,210
Get up.

36
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,620
Your Highness, the Prefect's Mansion caught fire.

37
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,490
What?

38
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,450
Your Highness, after you and Prefect Li Zhang left the County Office for Phoenix Mountain yesterday,

39
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,299
I took some people to raid the Prefect's Mansion quietly as you ordered.

40
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:27,029
When we arrived at the Prefect's Mansion in the afternoon,

41
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,499
it had been burned into ruins.

42
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,749
When did the fire start? Did anyone get hurt?

43
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,469
According to the people nearby, around noon yesterday,

44
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,619
a group of soldiers suddenly surrounded the Prefect's Mansion

45
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,499
and took away everyone there.

46
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,210
They set the Prefect's Mansion on fire.

47
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,469
Fortunately, it was during the day. There was a lot of noise.

48
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:45,180
The people nearby had been evacuated before the fire got bigger.

49
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,009
No one got hurt. A few houses nearby were destroyed by the fire.

50
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:50,479
Soldiers? What soldiers?

51
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,700
I... I didn't really see them.

52
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,549
- I dare not speculate.
- Feel free to tell us.

53
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:57,100
Well...

54
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,680
You took General Xiao's four soldiers with you.

55
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,679
There were soldiers going into the Prefect's Mansion before the fire and the people nearby saw them.

56
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:10,859
Did they wear the same clothes as General Xiao's men?

57
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,829
Yes.

58
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,139
What did the four soldiers coming with you say?

59
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,779
They had a big reaction.

60
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,470
They said someone wanted to frame them.

61
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,909
Your Highness, I didn't dare to speculate

62
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,549
because I think this matter is very strange.

63
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,570
Strange how?

64
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,669
General Xiao brought a limited number of soldiers.

65
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,319
Except those who followed you to the mountain,

66
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,339
and those who followed me to the Prefect's Mansion,

67
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,219
there are no more than four or five people left.

68
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,669
According to the people at the scene,

69
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,519
there were at least twenty soldiers when they set the fire.

70
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:39,209
How could General Xiao gather so many people in such a short time?

71
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:42,680
General Xiao's soldiers are all from Military Commissioner's army.

72
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,289
But there are tens of thousands of soldiers in the Military Commissioner's army.

73
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:48,209
These soldiers in Qianzhou

74
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:50,189
are not necessarily General Xiao's subordinates.

75
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:52,730
You mean General Leng?

76
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,330
What?

77
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,940
Your Highness, General Xiao is back.

78
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,950
Magistrate Zheng.

79
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,939
Commandery Prince An.

80
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:16,889
Well... Prefect Li is unconscious now.

81
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:22,129
General Xiao won't allow me to get a doctor here or visit him.

82
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,720
Well... If anything happens to Prefect Li at my office,

83
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,519
what should I do?

84
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,269
Go to the side hall and ask Miss Leng to come here.

85
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,270
Miss Leng?

86
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,730
Yes, yes. I'll go get her.

87
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,939
How is he doing?

88
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,589
I mean, I moved the stones for the whole night.

89
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,009
I've been so busy that I haven't had time to drink any water.

90
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:58,459
I got dust everywhere. But you only worry about him. Why don't you worry about me?

91
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:01,429
Aren't you standing here and denouncing me loudly?

92
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,589
Should I need to worry about you?

93
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,590
Fine.

94
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,629
See? He has woken up.

95
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:09,099
He is fine.

96
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:12,500

97
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,890

Your Highness, mercy!

106
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,619
Hurry and order someone you can trust to cordon off this courtyard.

107
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:43,119
Don't let anyone come near here without permission except for Leng Yue and Jing Yi!

108
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:44,379
- All right.
- Hurry.

109
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:45,990
Be careful.

- Yes!
- Yes!

114
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,330
You. Go.

115
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,929
Go.

116
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,939
- Miss Leng.
- Hurry.

117
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:07,710
Miss Leng, please.

118
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,739
What's going on here?

119
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,329
Commandery Prince An has urgent affairs to deal with.

120
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,490
No one is allowed to approach without permission.

121
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,650
Magistrate Zheng, please go back.

122
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,010
Urgent affairs?

123
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,039
Do you need me to send more people here to guard the yard?

124
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:24,909
General Xiao, feel free to order me if you need anything.

125
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:28,400
- I will...
- Go far away.

126
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,910
Do you hear me?

127
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,470
Well... Yes, I hear you.

128
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,749
What's the fuss about?

129
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:43,789
Just for Li Zhang?

130
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:45,039
Can he fly away?

131
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,369
It's Commandery Prince An's order.

132
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:48,550
You and Leng Yue go inside.

133
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,409
Your Highness, mercy. Your Highness, mercy.

134
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,730
Your Highness, mercy!

135
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,590
Your Highness, is Li Zhang awake?

136
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,760
I'm here.

137
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,360
What do you want to say?

138
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,930
Your Highness! Your Highness!

139
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,279
Your Highness, mercy! Your Highness, mercy.

140
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:19,239
Your Highness, I blew it up.

141
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,139
They all know it.

142
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:22,509
They are still alive.

143
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:25,610
Your Highness, run away!

144
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,089
Your Highness, you can't run. You can't run.

145
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,099
I will kill Xiao Jinyu! Kill Xiao Jinyu...

146
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:32,769
I will kill Xiao Jinyu!

147
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:33,899
Kill Xiao Jinyu... Kill Xiao Jinyu...

148
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:37,079
Where do you want me to go?

149
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:40,919
Your Highness. Your Highness. You run...

150
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,190
Your Highness, you can't run.

151
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,850
You are the rightful Emperor of Tang.

152
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,759
The country is yours.

153
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,189
You can't run away. You can't run away!

154
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:54,559
Nonsense! What are you talking about?

155
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:57,020
What the hell is he talking about?

156
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,260
Duke Chang has arrived!

157
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,990
Long live Your Majesty!

158
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,729
What's going on here?

159
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:13,169
Tell me about it.

160
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:17,199
Looks like the mastermind behind Li Zhang is really Duke Chang.

161
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,009
Li Zhang went crazy. Are you two also crazy?

162
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,320
Li Zhang suffered a brain injury.

163
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,519
He was crushed by rocks and buried for too long.

164
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,379
He had difficulty breathing, and the injury worsened because of suffocation.

165
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:29,650
That's why he becomes delirious.

166
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,650
Can he be cured?

167
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,599
This kind of brain injury is the same as a spine injury. It's incurable.

168
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,099
He will only get worse.

169
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,000
If he wakes up later, he will only become more delirious.

170
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,549
Do you hear that, Jinyu? Li Zhang went crazy.

171
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,050
He is talking crazy.

172
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,459
No, just because he is crazy, what he said just now is the truth.

173
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,509
Come on.

174
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,360
Emperor Wuzong's son is dead.

175
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,640
Everyone in court knows it. Even a roughneck like me knows it.

176
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,640
When Emperor Wuzong was alive, he saw his uncle as a thorn in the eye.

177
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,149
Emperor Wuzong's son is a forbidden subject for the His Majesty.

178
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,669
How dare you take such a guess.

179
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,899
Don't you want your head to stay on your neck?

180
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,889
Hold on!  Let me sort this out.

181
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,589
The current emperor is the uncle of the late Emperor Wuzong.

182
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:17,589
Which means if Duke Chang, the son of Emperor Wuzong, is still alive,

183
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,180
it should be Duke Chang who'd ascend the throne.

184
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:28,299
The rightful emperor Li Zhang kept mentioning Duke Chang.

185
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,000
- Yes.
- What?

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,179
You are the most perceptive and cautious one when it comes to these matters.

187
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,320
Why are you also nodding along?

188
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,399
I was being just like you

189
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,559
when Commandery Prince An said that to me earlier.

190
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,769
But I have to believe it now.

191
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,119
Didn't you hear a saying

192
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:44,539
that nothing is more true than what a madman says?

193
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,369
Earlier?

194
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,579
I mean, Jinyu, when did you start thinking about Duke Chang?

195
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,299
Before I came to Qianzhou.

196
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,530
What?

197
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,709
It was just my speculation.

198
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:59,709
Now it looks like I'm right about it.

199
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,999
There is no solid evidence to prove Duke Chang is still alive,

200
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:05,189
but those who cut off the message between Chang'an and Qianzhou,

201
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,139
and instructed Li Zhang to mint copper coins

202
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,779
should be this group of people under the banner of Duke Chang.

203
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,320
They are up to something.

204
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,689
Up to something? What?

205
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:18,080
To recruit soldiers... and usurp the throne.

206
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,659
Do you know what you are talking about?

207
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,420
Jing Yi, you also think so?

208
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,969
I don't want to think in this way.

209
00:10:23,969 --> 00:10:25,749
But it makes sense.

210
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,299
As the Prefect of Qianzhou, it's the most secretive way to let him

211
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,459
be in charge of recruiting soldiers.

212
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,320
Besides, he used illegally minted coins.

213
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,530
He doesn't need to touch the public money.

214
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,749
All he needs to do is to change the account book.

215
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,389
There is no time for the prologue.

216
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,299
I just want to know what we should do now.

217
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,949
Go back to Chang'an now?

218
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,629
We can't. The emperor just issued an imperial edict

219
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:47,820
and ordered Commandery Prince An to investigate the illegal minting of coins in Qianzhou.

220
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,949
I guess the eunuch who announced the imperial edict hasn't left Qianzhou yet.

221
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:53,030
We only have a cave that was blown up,

222
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,280
a Li Zhang who can't even explain his own identity,

223
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,859
and a suspect who has been dead for years in the emperor's mind.

224
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,669
If we go back to Chang'an now, we have no witness nor physical evidence.

225
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:04,240
It's not believable at all.

226
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,270
What should we do then?

227
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:10,930
How about writing a memorial to report these things to the emperor?

228
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,779
You can ask the emperor to issue an imperial edict to allow you to go back.

229
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,289
We can't, either.

230
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,359
The emperor might not believe it even when we tell him face-to-face.

231
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,340
It will be harder for him to believe it if we write it on paper.

232
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,200
If someone treacherous accuses us of making it up,

233
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,590
we will only receive the edict of punishment.

234
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:31,700
Nothing will work. Can you say something useful?

235
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,650
Take it easy.

236
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,290
Jing Yi is right.

237
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,509
We can't report it to the court rashly.

238
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:42,289
This group of people intercepted the messages between Chang'an and Qianzhou,

239
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:44,289
illegally minted a large number of coins,

240
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,540
and just killed the Minister of War, Feng Jie, who just finished

241
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,289
his inspection of the military affairs in the Southwest and rushed back to Chang'an.

242
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:53,359
I think Feng Jie got killed because he found something

243
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,529
during the military inspections.

244
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,780
It's very likely that the rebels are in the Southwest.

245
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:03,340
If that's the case, once they know that Li Zhang failed to kill us,

246
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,659
then it will be the rebels who want to kill us next.

247
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,189
Our safety is a small matter.

248
00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:10,749
But if we act rashly and alert them,

249
00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:14,799
making them take desperate action and go to war with the government,

250
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,589
plunging the people into the flames of war,

251
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,390
then it will really be a dilemma.

252
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,979
We have to find out where they are and wipe them out in one fell swoop

253
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,569
before they take any action.

254
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:26,670
I didn't bring many soldiers this time.

255
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,960
We can defend against some ordinary bandits, but not an army.

256
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,660
Why don't you go back to the base of the Military Commissioner with me?

257
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,889
No matter how wild this group of bandits are,

258
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:35,519
I don't believe they dare to break into the base of the Military Commissioner.

259
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,469
No, we can't.

260
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,299
Your Highness, I'm afraid the base of the Military Commissioner is also not safe now.

261
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:41,050
What?

262
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,050
I thought it was nonsense.

263
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,870
I wanted to tell you later.

264
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,859
This is the letter "that guy" sent to me just now.

265
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,880
Your Highness, take a look first.

266
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,190
To Commandery Prince An,
[Leng Peishan]

267
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:01,409
I heard that Commandery Prince An was ordered to investigate the case of illegally minting coins in Qianzhou.

268
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,939
I shouldn't have bothered you.

269
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,649
However, weird things have happened frequently in the army and people have gotten killed.

270
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,529
There might be evil spirits involved in this.

271
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,989
I'm afraid the soldiers will rise in revolt if we do nothing about it.

272
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,590
I wonder if you can come here in person and check it.

273
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,130
[Jing's Mansion]

274
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,520
Master.

275
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,330
Where is the news from?

276
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,859
Master, it's from Qianzhou.

277
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,340
It's about the Military Commissioner.

278
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,399
Strange things have happened frequently in the base of the Military Commissioner. No one knows what's going on.

279
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,660
About seven or eight people have gone mad.

280
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,439
Three people have committed suicide.

281
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,650
It's spreading panic in the army now.

282
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:50,299
[Princess Xiping Mansion]

283
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,330
Why did you lie to me?

284
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,060
How could you lie to me?

285
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,250
Your Grace.

286
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,409
What's the fuss about?

287
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:05,760
Your Grace, I just got the news that there are people looking for

288
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,440
the servants dismissed by us in the early years.

289
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,609
Who?

290
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,290
These people act in secret.

291
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:15,560
I just got wind of it and I think this matter is of great importance,

292
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,100
so I came to report it to you.

293
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,450
Your Grace.

294
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,500
Your Grace, don't worry. General Wu just left.

295
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,709
He shouldn't have gone far.

296
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:31,289
Do we need to send someone to get him back and ask him to find out who they are?

297
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:33,969
No. We can't let anyone know it,

298
00:14:33,969 --> 00:14:35,509
not even the people from the Three Judicial Offices.

299
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,349
Otherwise, Jinli and Jinyu will be in great danger.

300
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,760
Go to the mansion and find some guards you can trust.

301
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,730
Ask them to investigate it secretly.

302
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,310
- Remember to keep quiet about it.
- Yes.

303
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,439
- Hurry.
- Yes.

304
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,640
Go to the base of the Military Commissioner of Qianzhongdao?

305
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,449
Don't worry. It's my father's last wish

306
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:06,069
to overturn the case of your father and the soldiers of

307
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,779
the Military Commissioner of Jiannan.

308
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,180
I won't forget about it.

309
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,029
It's just that it implicates too many people.

310
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,709
I still need to elaborate on the plan carefully.

311
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,299
Otherwise, even with the evidence left by my father,

312
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,509
it's hard for us to solve it for good.

313
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,689
What's more, if we don't find out what's happening in the base of the Military Commissioner,

314
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,780
I'm afraid we can hardly go back to Chang'an safely.

315
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,339
I understand. I'll listen to you.

316
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:35,749
But the Military Commissioner's base is heavily guarded.

317
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,829
I heard that even a bird can't get anywhere near it.

318
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,829
Who would dare to make trouble there?

319
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,829
General Leng wrote a letter to Leng Yue.

320
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:50,509
He said that there have been several soldiers going crazy for no reason.

321
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:53,840
Some soldiers even committed suicide.

322
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,529
Within a few days,

323
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:59,469
the rumors are spreading in the army and causing panic.

324
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,219
What rumors?

325
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,640
The rumors of... evil spirits.

326
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,900
Evil spirits?

327
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,449
The Military Commissioner, Leng Peishan, who is Leng Yue's grandfather,

328
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:13,909
hopes I can leave for the base now to expel the evil spirits.

329
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:15,899
There is no evil spirit in the world.

330
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,389
Just take the ghost house built by Sir Witch Doctor,

331
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,959
everyone was talking about it like it was real,

332
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,979
but it turned out to be the wind.

333
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,949
If there is an evil spirit in this world,

334
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,270
the coroners don't need to do any autopsy at all.

335
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:31,499
Your Highness, do you really believe there are dangerous evil spirits in the world?

336
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:33,939
Master didn't talk about spiritual beings.

337
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:38,960
The so-called evil spirits are just the embodiment of evil minds.

338
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,219
However, the army of the Military Commissioner is a strong guard in the Southwest.

339
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:44,479
If anything happens to them,

340
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,869
those who will suffer are the people living in the Southwest.

341
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,069
This happened strangely.

342
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,629
Whether a ghost or a human being did it,

343
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,879
we have to find out the truth first

344
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,210
before we return to Chang'an to redress the case.

345
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,680
General Xiao, the people near the Prefect's Mansion said that it was the soldiers of the Military Commissioner who

346
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,770
I dare not tell any lie.

347
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,629
I got it.

348
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,429
General Xiao, is it really General Leng who ordered those people to do it?

349
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:16,569
We all know what kind of person General Leng is.

350
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,019
How would he join hands with someone like Li Zhang?

351
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,300
I know my brother.

352
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,069
He will never wrong a good person.

353
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,549
Nothing is clear yet.

354
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,099
We can only know the truth

355
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,589
after we go back to the base and investigate it.

356
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,839
Go back and rest.

357
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,819
We will leave early tomorrow morning.

358
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,420
Yes.

359
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,409
You are thoughtful indeed.

360
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:49,629
What should we do about Prefect Li?

361
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,119
It's an established fact that Li Zhang illegally minted coins,

362
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,479
but the mastermind behind him hasn't been captured yet.

363
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,619
I don't know how many more people are involved.

364
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,590
So we can't convict and punish him for now.

365
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,589
He is delirious and talking crazy now.

366
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,349
It's inconvenient to detain him at the County Office.

367
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:10,930
I've asked Jinli to find some people to imprison him secretly.

368
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,959
We will deal with him after we find out the truth.

369
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,049
I guess he got what he deserved.

370
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,510
When will we leave?

371
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,910
Your Highness, don't worry. With my family staying here,

372
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:24,660
my dad will take good care of the body of Sir Witch Doctor.

373
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:26,819
To make sure your family won't be implicated,

374
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:31,329
I will ask my men to send your family to a safe place.

375
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,839
And I can rest assured to entrust my father's body to your family.

376
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,980
It's just that I'm afraid...

377
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,080
I can't keep my promise this time.

378
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,120
Promise? What promise?

379
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,170
I promised you I will keep you safe forever.

380
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,509
You regret it?

381
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,390
No. Of course not.

382
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,290
Then you mean...

383
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,510
Chu Chu...

384
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,750
I should have sent you to a safe place to hide for a while,

385
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,390
or sent you back to Chang'an first.

386
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:13,760
But this time, your father's case has not been redressed.

387
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,479
If anyone becomes aware of your identity,

388
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,769
I'm afraid you will be in great danger.

389
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:21,409
What happened in the army is very strange.

390
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,790
I'm afraid it will also be dangerous.

391
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,720
After some thought,

392
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,980
- I think I have to take you with me and put you at risk.
- What?

393
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:33,460
Your Highness, are you going to take me with you to the base?

394
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,600
This will be a dangerous trip.

395
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,199
If you don't...

396
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,969
♫ The moment ♫

397
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,689
♫ You smile ♫

398
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,299
♫ Let me cherish it for good ♫

399
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,039
♫ Because of you ♫

400
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:54,440
♫ I care about my life ♫

401
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,119
♫ I'm not old yet ♫

402
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,849
♫ I still love you ♫

403
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:01,889
♫ At last I settle down for you ♫

404
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:09,100
♫ I can rely on you all my life ♫

405
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:14,200
Your Highness, I thought you would regret being with me.

406
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,639
I'm not afraid of any danger.

407
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,759
Besides, we promised each other in the cave

408
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,420
that no matter what happens, we will face it together.

409
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,870
As a dignified commandery prince, you can't break your promise.

410
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:35,800
Chu Chu, what I said and did in the cave that day...

411
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,470
was not honorable.

412
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,669
I think I took advantage of the situation.

413
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,159
I should have asked you again in a serious way.

414
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,200
But I'm afraid if I ask you again,

415
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,329
you will reject me.

416
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,129
I always keep my words.

417
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,260
I said yes and I won't regret it.

418
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,060
Chu Chu...

419
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:00,240
I know I'm not a likable man.

420
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,690
For a woman, I am not good enough to be a husband.

421
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,900
I always think that you don't know many men now.

422
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,500
After your father's case is redressed,

423
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,060
you will become a true lady from a family of loyal subjects.

424
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,549
After you meet all those handsome young masters in Chang'an,

425
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,770
you will get tired of me.

426
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,350
How will you still cherish me at that time?

427
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,789
I don't want you to fall for other men.

428
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,810
So I hurried to show you my love

429
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,530
and wanted to make you do the same thing.

430
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:39,650
Now I've confessed my nasty thoughts to you.

431
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:43,810
If you regret it now...  I won't blame you

432
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:47,259
♫ Let me cherish it for good ♫

433
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,049
♫ Because of you ♫

434
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,790
♫ I care about my life ♫

435
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:55,600
I don't like any other young master. I only like you.

436
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,040
Your Highness, don't worry.

437
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,889
No matter how many times you ask me, the answer will always be yes.

438
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:05,869
♫ I can rely on you all my life ♫

439
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,629
I tied a red string to the Tree of Love and made a wish.

440
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,040
They said the tree can make my dream come true.

441
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,840
But I still can't believe these things.

442
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,850
I want to hear your answer again.

443
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,200
Will you marry me?

444
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,280
Will you take all my love for you for the rest of your life?

445
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:35,059
I will.

446
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:41,100
♫ Spend our lives through time ♫

447
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,749
♫ Every time we see the setting sun ♫

448
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:48,269
♫ Every time we look back, we're by each other's side ♫

449
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:49,910
Chu Chu.

450
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,540
Father, I'm coming.

451
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,450
What are you doing here?

452
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,280
Mellow wine.

453
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,260
That's the wine for a heroine to get drunk.

454
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,590
Here, take the roast chicken.

455
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:38,100
A sip of wine and a bite of meat. Then beat me up.

456
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,849
Beat you up? Why?

457
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,129
I don't know.

458
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,880
Don't knights like you have to fight

459
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,009
after drinking to feel comfortable?

460
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:48,150
That's what the storyteller in Guangtai House said.

461
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,050
Give me some wine.

462
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,240
Just this little bit?

463
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,380
With your little tolerance,

464
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,850
if you get drunk, I'll have to carry you down.

465
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,140
I'm not asking for trouble.

466
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,630
I'm glad that you didn't ask for trouble.

467
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,279
If you really don't want to go to the base,

468
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,120
just talk to Commandery Prince An. Or you can just leave.

469
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,319
Commandery Prince An won't make you go there.

470
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,900
Why are you drinking alone on the roof of the County Office?

471
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,880
I have to go this time.

472
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,980
Chu Chu.

473
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:47,030
Do you really like Chu Chu or are you just used to bossing her around?

474
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,570
I never wanted to boss her around.

475
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:55,120
She is the best coroner in the world.

476
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,890
She is bold but cautious.

477
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:01,889
I respect her just as I respect all talented and upright people.

478
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,490
She works for me as a coroner.

479
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:06,999
I'm not bossing her around. She is helping me.

480
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,950
I'm not talking about coroner.

481
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,650
I'm asking...

482
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,520
if you really like her.

483
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,319
She is the best girl in the world.

484
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,249
How can I not like her?

485
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,389
Do you think she is the best girl in the world?

486
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,290
Don't you think so?

487
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,180
She is my sister.

488
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,710
Of course, my sister is the best girl in the world.

489
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,660
But you just...

490
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,130
I saw it.

491
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,210
Are you going to take her with you?

492
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,170
Yes.

493
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:02,060
The Three Judicial Offices, Chongrenfang, North Street, Chang'an.

494
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,150
What did you say?

495
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,700
It's my residence in Chang'an.

496
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:12,140
You can come to visit Chu Chu anytime you want.

497
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:16,129
[Three Judicial Offices]

498
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,670
Take this token and come to my residence in Chang'an.

499
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,860
No one will stop you when they see it.

500
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,660
Remember what you just said.

501
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:41,300
No matter how high your rank is, no matter how far you are,

502
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,660
if you dare hurt Chu Chu,

503
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,800
I will never let you go.

504
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,060
You don't have to hide it from me.

505
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,899
I don't know much about politics,

506
00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:12,080
but I also grew up with you and Commandery Prince An.

507
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,649
I know what you two meant when you winked at each other. I understand

508
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:21,070
that man's letter came at a perfect time, didn't it?

509
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,609
We just caught Li Zhang.

510
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:25,390
His soldiers set the Prefect's Mansion on fire.

511
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:28,160
Then his man sent such a letter.

512
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,679
Evil spirits.

513
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,079
I think he is the biggest evil.

514
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,009
What if it's just a coincidence?

515
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:39,200
Coincidence?

516
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,650
I don't think you know it.

517
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,679
Commandery Prince An has been suspecting him for some time.

518
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,400
He asked me to write a letter of no importance to throw a stone to clear the road.

519
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:52,830
As a result, something is wrong with him.

520
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:58,309
Your Highness, since you think Miss Leng's grandpa inviting us to his base is a trap,

521
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,450
why are you still going?

522
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,900
You have to play with fire to stay warm.

523
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:08,869
Chu Chu, remember, after we arrive at the base, except for my brother

524
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,119
and the people coming with us from Chang'an,

525
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,410
any other people's words can't be trusted.

526
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,009
I got it.

527
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:20,850
Your Highness, you are preparing for the worst again. Right?

528
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,860
Miss Leng must feel bad now.

529
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,780
I know that feeling.

530
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:38,049
The feeling that you can't stop worrying if your family is a bad person.

531
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,500
She will think it through.

532
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,079
Even if she can't think it through for now,

533
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:50,340
someone will help her think it through.

534
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:58,319
Leng Yue, he is still your grandpa.

535
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,860
You know what kind of person he is.

536
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:08,330
You know him too, don't you?

537
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,849
Considering how cowardly you are,

538
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,299
even you are volunteering to go to the base and fish for information with Commandery Prince An's guards.

539
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:13,609
What does that mean?

540
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:17,260
Obviously, you think he is up to something and you want to find it out.

541
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:22,920
Duke Chang and the son of Emperor Wuzong are just excuses and disguises.

542
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,809
I think he is probably the mastermind.

543
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,639
Hush. You can't say that.

544
00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:30,369
Why not?

545
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:32,129
Even you care about my feelings.

546
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,469
What about him? When did he ever care about me?

547
00:29:34,469 --> 00:29:36,529
He doesn't care about me now.

548
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:39,260
He was the same when my father and mother died.

549
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,870
He only sent a letter that the Military Commissioner of Jiannan rebelled.

550
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,370
He was stationed in the Southwest and couldn't return to Chang'an.

551
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:50,130
Then my parents died in the insurgency in Chang'an.

552
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,660
Now I know it.

553
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,110
It was not a rebellion, it was...!

554
00:29:59,979 --> 00:30:02,390
You can't say that, either.

555
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:15,310
I used to think he was just ruthless,

556
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,429
but at least he was loyal to his country.

557
00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:21,029
Now I know he isn't even loyal.

558
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:24,320
What kind of person is he? He is a bastard!

559
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,580
- Give it to me.
- Give it back to me! I bought it!

560
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,759
I also bought the roast chicken. It didn't cost me any lesser.

561
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:34,550
Let's change it.

562
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:44,199
Leng Yue, do you know why Commandery Prince An can solve every case?

563
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,279
Normally, when there are several totally different possibilities,

564
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,650
people will subconsciously choose the one they want to believe.

565
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,889
If they can't disprove the other possibilities,

566
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:02,009
they will start to feel irritable and depressed.

567
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,849
Just like the way you are.

568
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:07,050
You are even venting your feelings on the roast chicken.

569
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,409
But Commandery Prince An is different.

570
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,279
When he is in such a situation,

571
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,249
he will choose not to believe any of it

572
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,959
and then deduce the truth step by step through the evidence he collects.

573
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,729
And the truth might be completely different

574
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,079
from the previous possibilities.

575
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,510
Just like Li Zhang and Xu Rugui.

576
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,409
Even the storyteller in Guangtai House

577
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,149
can't make up such a strange story. Right?

578
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:31,449
But when Commandery Prince An shows you the evidence,

579
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:35,060
you have to believe that's the truth.

580
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,100
What do you want to say?

581
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:43,409
I just want to say we are all mortals.

582
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,919
We have feelings.

583
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,790
It's normal to feel agitated and depressed

584
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,790
because you can't prove your speculation for now.

585
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:54,249
But you also need to know the truth in the end

586
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,740
might be completely different from what you think now.

587
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,820
No matter what the final truth is, we will face it together with you.

588
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,569
As for me sneaking into the base, don't worry about it.

589
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:09,630
I'm an expert in putting on an act and asking around.

590
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:12,990
Besides, I can still run away if it doesn't work out. You know me.

591
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:17,680
If I want to escape, even the guards in the palace can't get me.

592
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:22,779
Right. I remember how timid you are.

593
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:25,060
You must run faster than a rabbit if anything goes wrong.

594
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,420
I'm not worried about you.

595
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,220
Are you still coming with us?

596
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,020
Of course.

597
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:35,820
But don't worry, I won't do anything stupid.

598
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,730
I just want to know the truth.

599
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:41,230
Fine.

600
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,129
Go back to your room after you finish the roast chicken.

601
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,700
I've prepared the bath water for you.

602
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:49,770
Go back to my room after I finish the roast chicken?

603
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,789
You took my wine.

604
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:58,260
According to the storyteller, I should beat you up first.

605
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,250
Don't run!

606
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:12,810
[Ready to pick up the goods]

607
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,249
Manager, I've tidied the things up.

608
00:33:24,249 --> 00:33:30,750
Go to the pharmacy now and get this prescription filled.

609
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,749
(Prescription)
Remember, don't just go to one pharmacy.

610
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,450
Get it filled in several pharmacies.

611
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:45,219
Who is so bold to intercept and kill a minister

612
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,880
and rescue the criminal under my watch!

613
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,800
Your Majesty, calm your anger.

614
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,000
Calm my anger?

615
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,649
How can I calm my anger?

616
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,380
Xue Rucheng took the criminal Xu Rugui back to Chang'an.

617
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,349
But Xu Rugui was taken away in the suburbs of Chang'an.

618
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:09,479
As the Minister of War, he was nearly killed

619
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,279
under the protection of the Imperial Guard in broad daylight!

620
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,449
We even don't know who did it.

621
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:18,109
Well, Commandery Prince An is not in Chang'an now.

622
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:22,180
Is there no judge who can arrest criminals?

623
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:28,569
Your Majesty, these officials are incompetent.

624
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:32,839
You can denounce them and punish them as you want.

625
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:38,249
You don't have to save face for them and make yourself feel bad.

626
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,519
Your Majesty, getting angry can hurt your health.

627
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,009
You must take care of yourself.

628
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:51,479
Your Majesty, you have been busy with national affairs recently.

629
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,410
Have a cup of soothing tea first.

630
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:25,949
Master, when it comes to making the emperor happy,

631
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:27,979
you are the number one in the world.

632
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,700
No one can do it better than you do.

633
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:40,810
Listen. Only when I am happy, I'll have the mood to make him happy.

634
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:44,309
Well, Master, what are you happy about?

635
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:48,109
Tell me and let me share your happiness.

636
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:51,030
What else could it be?

637
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:55,379
Zhou Han finally did a good job.

638
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,580
Shouldn't I be happy about it?

639
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,679
Is there any news from Zhou Han?

640
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,189
Where did he take Xu Rugui to?

641
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:10,520
Xu Rugui was taken...

642
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,930
Zhou Han got Xu Rugui?

643
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,629
Wait, Master. Hold on.

644
00:36:15,629 --> 00:36:18,160
- Zhou Han got Xu Rugui?
- Yeah.

645
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,890
Zhou Han only said

646
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,869
he planted his men among the soldiers of the Shence Army

647
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,799
who escorted Xu Rugui.

648
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,470
But he didn't mention that he got Xu Rugui out.

649
