00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,320
Leng Yue got hurt for saving me.

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,080
General Xiao arrived at that time.

3
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,659
His Highness found fake copper cash in the pay of General Xiao.

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,419
His Highness said Prefect Li Zhang might play a role.

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,319
Lord Jing and His Highness made a bet and went to the county government.

6
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,739
I took His Highness and General Xiao home.

7
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,650
My brother met us.

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,089
He scolded me for that.

9
00:00:35,089 --> 00:00:36,379
He's really ill-tempered.

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,040
I can't do anything about that.

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,379
Sir, would you please do me a favor?

12
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,589
We'd love to. What's it?

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,199
It's late now.

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,820
Will you allow us to stay here for one night?

15
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,070
Are you serious?

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,729
Stay here?

17
00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:01,319
Sir, we are a family of coroners.

18
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:05,429
Even the villagers dislike getting in contact with us

19
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,809
because they think it's unlucky.

20
00:01:07,809 --> 00:01:10,710
Will you really stay here?

21
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,609
As a coroner, you are helping the dead and the government.

22
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,429
How could it be unlucky?

23
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,979
Every government office has its mortuary.

24
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,650
Chu Chu saw that there're also such rooms in my home in Chang'an.

25
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,850
If you have to say so,

26
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,109
I'm about the same as you are.

27
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,069
You have such a room, too?

28
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,399
Yes, they really have one.

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,000
I even performed an autopsy there.

30
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,309
Autopsy results are the basis for investigation.

31
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,899
One false step will make a great difference.

32
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,109
As a judge, we have to be cautious.

33
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,670
Go tidy up a room and prepare some dishes and wine.

34
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,419
You don't know where the wine is.

35
00:01:53,419 --> 00:01:55,429
I store them. I know where it is.

36
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,230
I will go take it.

37
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,870
Come with me.

38
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,729

- Yes.

40
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:08,959
Go visit Jing Yi and tell him I'm staying here tonight.

41
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,429
Ask him to do whatever he should do. He doesn't need to wait for me.

[Episode 11]

46
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,699
Brother, what's the matter?

47
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,959
Tell me who those people are.

48
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:55,579
You heard that.

49
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,179
One is a judge from the imperial court.

50
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,339
The other is his elder brother, a general.

51
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,119
His men once suppressed bandits around here.

52
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:04,859
Every word is true.

53
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,299
You went to Chang'an alone.

54
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,869
How could you know people like that?

55
00:04:07,869 --> 00:04:09,340
I met them on the exam.

56
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,269
You went their house on the exam?

57
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:13,919
I've been helping him investigate when I was in Chang'an.

58
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,380
So he let me stay so that he could ask for information.

59
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,539
You even lived in his house?

60
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,019
Jing Yi should hold Li Zhang for half a day.

61
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,339
We will meet him in the government office after we have supper.

62
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:27,360
Why do you want to stay here now?

63
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,619
Isn't it odd?

64
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:33,940
Chu Chu isn't treated as she's a biological daughter.

65
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,179
They are all good to her, aren't they?

66
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:39,220
Yes, they are good to her.

67
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,869
But it's weird.

68
00:04:40,869 --> 00:04:41,999
Weird?

69
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:45,629
As her father, Chu Ping shows his love.

70
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,789
But it's in a polite way.

71
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,490
Polite?

72
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,819
I once left the capital for a case.

73
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,699
Mother was worrying all night.

74
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,560
When I went for her for some tea,

75
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,669
she said in anger she wouldn't allow me to drink.

76
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,159
Chu Chu has left home for so long without any news.

77
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,529
Now she's back all of a sudden.

78
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,969
But Chu Ping didn't blame her at all.

79
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,190
Maybe it's because Chu Ping isn't as bad-tempered as Mother.

80
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,089
No.

81
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:19,250
And Chu He, he didn't act like an elder brother.

82
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,059
Chu He is a bit weird.

83
00:05:22,059 --> 00:05:25,669
If you were sent back by others after being away home for a long time,

84
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:27,809
I'd first see if you are all right.

85
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,649
As long as you are fine and the visitors aren't malicious,

86
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,999
I'd say thanks of course.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,699
But Chu He didn't.

88
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,849
It seems the kinder we are, the more he cares about who we are

89
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:41,040
and the more malicious he is.

90
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,099
You are right.

91
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:45,151
As a girl with an unimpeachable reputation,

92
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:47,809
how could you just live in a strange man's house at random?

93
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,469
You don't know what intentions he had.

94
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:51,700
He had good intentions.

95
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,859
You know what?

96
00:05:53,859 --> 00:05:56,819
I lost my purse then and was wronged by others.

97
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:59,599
He caught the thief and got my purse back.

98
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:02,859
When I was hijacked in the street, he arranged his men to save me.

99
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:05,699
What's more, he has never looked down upon me.

100
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,999
He said I'm the best coroner he has ever met.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,969
I failed the last test for coroner, but he is willing to give me another chance.

102
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:17,299
He said he'd take me back to Chang'an if he agreed to take me on.

103
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:21,219
Even if he decides not to hire me, he will investigate my background

104
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:24,939
so as to rank me as a coroner.

105
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:27,400
He even wants to investigate your background?

106
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,179
Brother, it's an item in the ranking test.

107
00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:33,370
You took it in your first test, right?

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,939
Yes, that's true.

109
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:40,639
I know others said I was born out of wedlock.

110
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,969
But you've asked me to ignore the words since I was a little girl.

111
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,619
You told me that's nonsense.

112
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:47,729
He's the smartest and fairest person I've ever seen.

113
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:49,729
He won't trust the nonsense readily.

114
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:52,440
He will figure it out himself.

115
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,689
Lass, do you have to be the coroner?

116
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,629
Our family are all coroners for generations.

117
00:06:57,629 --> 00:06:59,719
I'm one of us. Of course, I will be a coroner.

118
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,230
This...

119
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,910
If the Handsome Judge doesn't exist,

120
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:12,689
the coroner around him should be the one making people jealous.

121
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:17,679
I thought he sent me home because he didn't want me.

122
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:19,629
But he is staying for one night.

123
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:21,119
It means I still have a chance.

124
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:24,100
That's my last chance. I will surely take the opportunity.

125
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,499
You want to leave home so much to work with him?

126
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:27,639
Of course not.

127
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,440
After I make some achievements, I will take you all to Chang'an.

128

131
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:40,820
I don't like it.

132
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,769
You talked to me about our father.

133
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:54,519
So you doubt it's related to the Chu family?

134
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:57,639
The Chu family and Father were close.

135
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:00,289
There must be clues about Father here.

136
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,599
The Chu family hide Chu Chu's background on purpose

137
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,840
and Chu Chu hides the history of the pendant deliberately.

138
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,189

139
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:13,410
Are you sure the witch doctor is our father?

140
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,810
That's the only possibility.

141
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,409
The Chu family are honest people.

142
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,409
How about asking them straightly?

143
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,210

Okay. It's up to you.

145

Will you ask some guardsmen here?

146
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,089
Or I call some soldiers?

147

Otherwise, you will live with me tonight.

00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,389
You silly boy. Why are you standing here?

182
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:27,780
Serve the liquor to the guests.

183
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,989
Chu made all dishes herself.

184
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,489
She said it's for thanking you.

185
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:43,680
If you don't like any of the dishes, just punish her.

186
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,349
Your Highness, please.

187
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,370
So this is a tea party in Qianzhou?

188
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,239
Your Highness, both tea and liquor are for a party.

189
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:23,169
I especially took two chefs from the government office.

190
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:25,509
They are no better than chefs in Chang'an.

191
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,579
But they are good at making Qianzhou dishes.

192
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,179
Please enjoy, Your Highness.

193
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,399
Please enjoy, Miss Leng.

194
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,639
Yes. Please enjoy.

195
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,309
Please enjoy.

196
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,749
Prefect Li, you are well prepared.

197
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,219
It's my pleasure.

198
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,069
Your Highness.

199
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,000
Your Highness. Miss Leng. Please.

200
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,099
Is it…

201
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,050
Thank you for the reward, Your Highness.

202
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,330
Why are you pretending?

203
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,899
- This...
- What?

204
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,779
Your Highness, sorry I don't understand.

205
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,930
Please make it clear.

206
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:41,039
Prefect Li, Magistrate Zheng, can't you see the copper coins are illegal?

207
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,189
This...

208
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:45,970
[Qian]

209
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,859
It's my fault.

210
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,739
As the prefect of Qianzhou, I don't know such a monstrous crime

211
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,559
was committed in my rule.

212
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,669
I cannot get away with it.

213
00:12:56,669 --> 00:12:58,439
Please punish, Your Highness.

214
00:12:58,439 --> 00:13:02,030
Yes, I can't avoid punishment, either.

215
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,369
Prefect Li, Magistrate Zheng.

216
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,429
Please get up.

217
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,219
Prefect Li, you can't blame yourself.

218
00:13:09,219 --> 00:13:11,819
The copper coins are good enough to pass for genuine.

219
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:13,539
It's hard for ordinary people to figure it out.

220
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:17,279
I found it all of a sudden in the market on my way to the county government office.

221
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,539
Anyway, it's a serious matter.

222
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:22,399
Please investigate thoroughly.

223
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,639
I will do it.

224
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,479
Copper cash casting needs tremendous manpower and materials.

225
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,579
As the Prefect of Qianzhou, you know the situation the best.

226
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,719
It's the right thing to let you investigate the case.

227
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,180
So just go ahead.

228
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,811
- I…
- That's enough. Let's stop talking about business.

229
00:13:38,811 --> 00:13:42,120
Let's just enjoy the party.

230
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,099
Hey, don't just keep eating.

231
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,580
Do you have any news?

232
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,149
I will tell you if there is.

233
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,489
But I don't get any news.

234
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:12,459
Normally, if Xu Rugui doesn't have any news,

235
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:18,939
there should be the pony express about Xiao Jinyu's death.

236
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,119
But there is no news.

237
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,730
What should we do

238
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,020
if my master asks for it?

239
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,879
It's not an easy thing for you.

240
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,879
Xu Rugui didn't do it well.

241
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:40,109
It made you suffer hardship.

242
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,629
Yes, how awful!

243
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,639
He's been fond of food and drink when nothing bad happens.

244
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,320
But we have to handle it when something happens.

245
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:54,139
Will Xu Rugui take the chance to escape because he thought Eunuch Qin

246
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,949
isn't as powerful as before?

247
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,570
No, he won't.

248
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,069
Where can he escape to?

249
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,839
His home is here.

250
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,450
He has his wife and concubines as well as his children here.

251
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,090
He won't be as inhumane as Xiao Heng was.

252
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,919
Stop!

253
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,989
It's the anniversary of Prince Consort's death tomorrow.

254
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,850
Aren't you afraid he enters your dream?

255
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,330
You…

256
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,319
Stop talking nonsense.

257
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:28,680
It's really unlucky.

258
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,989
Your Highness.

259
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:36,390
I'm not drunk.

260
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,809
Your Highness. The road is wet.

261
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,389
Mind your step! Your Highness.

262
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,819
Your Highness. I'm slow-witted.

263
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,939
I should be punished with one cup.

264
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:45,359
No, no, no. It should be three cups.

265
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:47,049
Three cups.

266
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:49,169
Magistrate Zheng. Rest early.

267
00:15:49,169 --> 00:15:51,190
Let's gather next time.

268
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,500
Yes. Yes.

269
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,300
Yes.

270
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,370
What's wrong? Are you all right?

271
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,789
I'm okay.

272
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,329
I was drinking rashly.

273
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,660
You are too thin to bear it.

274
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,700
Take this. You will be fine soon.

275
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,879
You didn't allow me to drink and even drank for me.

276
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,839
Why did you flaunt your superiority?

277
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,939
I didn't.

278
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,329
You can't drink for the injuries.

279
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,660
I've told you I'm fine.

280
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,340
You need to meet His Highness, right?

281
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,489
Oh, yes.

282
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,069
I will go soon.

283
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,619
I will keep watching here.

284
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,210
If anyone asks for anything, I will say you are buying food for me.

285
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,099
Are you taking me as a fool?

286
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:03,180
I can see that Zheng Youde is truly drunk but Li Zhang is pretending.

287
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,759
Fine.

288
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,769
Wait for me with the night snack.

289
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,370
Just go ahead.

290
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,570
Your Highness, why are you standing here?

291
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,069
I haven't drunk for long. It makes me a bit dizzy.

292
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,269
I'm out here to sober up a bit.

293
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,479
Great! I just made some soup for it.

294
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,640
Just take it before it cools down.

295
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,129
Thank you.

296
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,659
It's my pleasure. I prepared it when I made dishes.

297
00:18:08,659 --> 00:18:09,649
You are suffering from indigestion.

298
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,489
You will feel uncomfortable without soup for sobering up after drinking.

299
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,610
How do you know my suffering?

300
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,099
I've seen it on the way back.

301
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,279
You didn't like cold food nor stodge.

302
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,419
You didn't drink cold water no matter how thirsty you were.

303
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:28,409
You've kept your hand in the chest when you were taking a nap.

304
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,920
Most people with stomach illness have this habit.

305
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,419
Thank you for paying attention to me.

306
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:38,919
But please keep it as a secret.

307
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,500
And don't let my brother and Jing Yi know that.

308
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,210
They don't know it?

309
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,819
It's no big deal.

310
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,309
If they know it, they will accommodate themselves to me.

311
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,210
It's troublesome.

312
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,940
Finish this.

313
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,140
Then I will keep it a secret for you.

314
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,410
Thank you.

315
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,599
It's me who should say so.

316
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,489
My family is very hospitable.

317
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,239
But as coroners, people often avoid us on walking in the street,

318
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,799
let alone coming to visit.

319
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,559
You are willing to eating and living here.

320
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,129
All of us are very happy.

321
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,960
- Really?
- Sure.

322
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,599
About what happened today, my family can talk to others for years.

323
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,039
What I wanted to ask is, are you really happy for my visiting?

324
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,040
I…

325
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,159
I…

326
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,209
At first, I didn't want you to come.

327
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,350
You said you would send me home if you decided to refuse me.

328
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,819
I was afraid you would leave me home and refuse me after sending me back.

329
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:09,979
Meanwhile, I don't have a good reputation here.

330
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,950
I feared that you might change your mind after you knew that even if you planned to hire me.

331
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,690
Reputation?

332
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,430
Chu He and I weren't born by the same mother.

333
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,520
His mother was my father's wife.

334
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,490
She died of dystocia after giving birth to Chu He.

335
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,749
I never know who my mother was.

336
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:33,200
People here always said I was an illegitimate child.

337
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,039
Anyway, I don't mind it now.

338
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,830
You said I only need to act well and wait for your decision.

339
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,649
You haven't told me your decision, so I can't think randomly.

340
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:49,110
I choose to work with you, so I should trust you.

341
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,400
Here. Open it.

342
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:17,280
Your Highness, what is this?

343
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,589
Your tools were ruined when you worked for me.

344
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:22,730
I should compensate you.

345
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:26,439
I got the materials from the best swordsmith in Chang'an.

346
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,199
They are tough and corrosion-resistant.

347
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,919
But I didn't have too much time with tough conditions on the way

348
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,570
to make it more precise.

349
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,590
You made them yourself?

350
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:41,870
On our way here from Chang'an?

351
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,569
It's impossible.

352
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,440
I've been with you all the time.

353
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,950
You were reading or reviewing the files.

354
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,919
I didn't see you doing this.

355
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,589
I made them during the night.

356
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:51,899
Night?

357
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:54,400
You didn't sleep?

358
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,670
I used to sleep little since I was a child.

359
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,299
As long as you like it, my efforts were not in vain.

360
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:03,780
Of course, I like it, but…

361
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,799
It's too valuable.

362
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,100
It's valuable only if you can get along with it.

363
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,130
Lord Jing.

364
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,159
Lord Jing, have you eaten yet?

365
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,941
My father went out for liquor and he'll be back soon.

366
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:21,679
Will you have a drink?

367
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,630
No, thanks.

368
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,849
May I speak to His Highness in private?

369
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,710
Okay. I will be in there.

370
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:30,460
Chu Chu. Do you have food that I can take away? Please pack some for me.

371
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,320
Okay.

372
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:41,131
Did you get the ins and outs about Li Zhang and Zheng Youde?

373
00:22:41,131 --> 00:22:43,039
Zheng Youde didn't act abnormally.

374
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,119
But his words are different from Chu He's.

375
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,849
It's true he doesn't bully people.

376
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:52,070
Anyway, he isn't a good officer, but an honest officer at most.

377
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,190
Honest like a bungler.

378
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:57,810
Even the Deputy Magistrate under him has more brains than him.

379
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,389
We can see through the cases he dealt with these years

380
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:04,740
that he's slow-witted but conscientious.

381
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,830
How about Li Zhang?

382
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,770
He must know something about the copper cash casting.

383
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:13,770
I just gave the case to him without any hesitation as per your words.

384
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:19,240
Then he pretended to be drunk early because he's afraid I'd ask more.

385
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,799
Yes, I lost the bet.

386
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,050
But I wonder if the information about

387
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,620
the Chu family are worth five gold coins.

388
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,850
Say it.

389
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,899
I asked Zheng Youde for information about the Chu family.

390
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,229
Before Zheng Youde came to Guanling County for the post,

391
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,989
Chu Chu has lived in the Chu family.

392
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,589
So he doesn't know who Chu Chu's biological mother is.

393
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,349
Anyway, according to Zheng Youde,

394
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:48,530
every one of the Chu family is a freak.

395
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,109
What do you mean?

396
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:55,370
The family didn't contact people at ordinary times.

397
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,320
But they offered sacrifice to the death

398
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,209
without ties of consanguinity with them.

399
00:24:01,209 --> 00:24:02,829
They live frugally.

400
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,869
But they are generous to the dead.

401
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,509
Your Highness, don't you think it's weird?

402
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,510
Weird?

403
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,869
Do you mean the tomb of Chu Chu's mother may be there?

404
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,520
How is it? Is it worth five coins?

405
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,510
Lord Jing.

406
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,310
- Thank you.
- Be careful.

407
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,280
- The officer…
- Be careful.

408
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,180
I'm leaving.

409
00:24:36,468 --> 00:24:38,168
Mind your step.

410
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,839
Brother. Brother, you are drunk. Get in.

411
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:44,450
I am not drunk. I'm very awake.

412
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,509
What's going on?

413
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:48,089
I didn't expect he can't drink.

414
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,140
He was fine just now.

415
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,300
I didn't get drunk.

416
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:55,670
You said you're an official from Chang'an.

417
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,180
I don't believe it.

418
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,700
Prove it.

419
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,059
Brother, stop jabbering Grandpa is sleeping.

420
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:03,700
You'd go sleep too. It's none of your business.

421
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,470
Do you dare?

422
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,439
What should I do to prove it?

423
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,649
There is a haunted house.

424
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:15,759
The one the witch doctor lived in.

425
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,169
If you can catch the ghost, I will trust you.

426
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,059
The witch doctor lived in a haunted house?

427
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:22,920
Brother, stop talking nonsense.

428
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,300
Go back to your room.

429
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,200
Chu Chu.

430
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,599
Is it true?

431
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:30,690
It's true.

432
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:38,670
The house has become haunted... for years.

433
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,259
Everyone in Pingle knows it.

434
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:47,040
If you don't dare, don't come for Chu Chu again.

435
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:57,000
Okay. I will go with you tomorrow morning.

436
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,590
Now. Not tomorrow morning.

437
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:03,620
The ghost appears at night, not in the morning.

438
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,450
Are you scared?

439
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,080
You hear it?

440
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,380
The ghost is crying.

441
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:25,040
It's from the house.

442
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,980
So what?

443
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:32,100
Do you dare to go?

444
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:41,910
Since it is so, please lead us the way.

445
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:42,920
Your Highness

446
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,400
Do you really dare to go?

447
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,199
I've never seen a ghost before.

448
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,679
So I can take the chance to increase my knowledge.

449
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,330
Brother Chu, please.

450
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,109
General Xiao, please stop His Highness.

451
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,369
I haven't seen a ghost, either.

452
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,520
I will go with Jinyu.

453
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,300
Let's go.

454
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,220
Wait for me.

455
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,559
You really went to buy the snacks?

456
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,860
Of course.

457
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,650
How do you feel? Are you sober now?

458
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,610
Yes.

459
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,199
Why are you so gentle today?

460
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,310
I'm a bit…

461
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,460
Get up. Remember you are Commandery Prince An now.

462
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,680
His Highness can't sit like that.

463
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:51,330
So you are treating me as I'm His Highness?

464
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,880
His Highness ordered that I'd cooperate with you.

465
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,550
Tell me the truth.

466
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:05,760
Did you lose your heart to His Highness?

467
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,450
You are not awake, right?

468
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,390
What nonsense are you talking about?

469
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,479
When Princess Xiping asked you to come to Qianzhou,

470
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,299
didn't she tell you she wants you to marry His Highness?

471
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:18,779
You agreed to come to Qianzhou.

472
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:21,409
Does it mean you agree with the marriage?

473
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,369
What are you talking about?

474
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,140
My auntie never mentioned that to me.

475
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,980
What's more, His Highness and you are my best bros.

476
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,260
Who will marry her bro?

477
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,870
You are a girl.

478
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,139
I won't take you as my bro.

479
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,560
Okay. Sister and brother. Sister and brother?

480
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,680
No.

481
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,430
Sisters. Will it be all right?

482
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,769
You are still drunk, aren't you?

483
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,580
I will accept the snack. Thank you.

484
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,000
Go back to sleep quickly.

485
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,250
Sisters?

486
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,730
I don't want to be.

487
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,090
[Jing Manor]

488
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,050
[Qian]

489
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:16,660
Why are you sitting here alone?

490
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,070
Darling, aren't you sleeping?

491
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,860
Do you meet any difficulties or did you buy something secretly?

492
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,979
Darling, it's no big deal.

493
00:29:29,979 --> 00:29:32,970
Don't bother.

494
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,950
Then forget it.

495
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:40,210
I also don't want to concern about your things.

496
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:45,559
I'm here originally to tell you how to solve the marriage

497
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,990
of Commandery Prince An and Leng Yue.

498
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:53,021
Anyway, since you don't want to bother, I'm leaving now.

499
00:29:53,021 --> 00:29:54,700
Hey, no, please don't.

500
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,020
Darling. Please calm your anger.

501
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,280
I'm begging you.

502
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,940
Please sit down, my darling.

503
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,380
Darling, you like the jade bracelet with lotus on

504
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,479
from the Han palace sold in Antique Store, right?

505
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,710
I will buy it for you tomorrow.

506
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,729
It's been a while.

507
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,009
It must have been sold out.

508
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,980
As long as you like it, it'll be yours.

509
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:26,510
I will get it for you no matter how.

510
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,910
That's about right.

511
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,040
Then please tell me the details.

512
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,360
You know what?

513
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:39,460
Nice. Okey.

514
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,630
Brother. Brother!

515
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,729
Forget it. Let's go back.

516
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:55,159
No. We have to catch the ghost today.

517
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,510
Don't be scared. I will protect you.

518
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,889
Is it that place?

519
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,699
That's it.

520
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,900
Do you dare to enter?

521
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,919
Brother, please mess the pile up.

522
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,880
Okay. I will take something for it.

523
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,190
Why do you do that?

524
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,690
Don't you want me to catch the ghost?

525
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,679
Do you mean the ghost is hiding here?

526
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,610
No.

527
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:22,710
It should be that the so-called ghost is trapped in.

528
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:40,909
Chu Chu. You said the house was like that when the witch doctor lived here?

529
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:42,439
It happened when I was a child.

530
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,129
One day, the house suddenly made the noise.

531
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,180
Sir Witch Doctor wasn't scared at all.

532
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:51,510
I was scared at first but not later after I got used to it.

533
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,419
There is no so-called ghost.

534
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:55,409
It's just because it's windy at night in the mountainous area.

535
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,820
The wall affects the wind direction.

536
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:01,129
So it caused the cry.

537
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,830
Make way, please.

538
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,979
Brother.

539
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,580
Brother!

540
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,980
Be careful.

541
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,700
The ghost cry is gone.

542
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,180
What's going on?

543
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,439
Father could see it all.

544
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,189
He must have done it on purpose.

545
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,190
On purpose?

546
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,170
Brother, there is an interlayer.

547
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,429
Why is there something here?

548
00:34:01,429 --> 00:34:03,049
Why is it hidden here?

549
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:05,550
Did Sir Witch Doctor put it here?

550
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:08,020
Come on. Take it out.

551
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:25,490
Luckily, it's not Sir Witch Doctor.

552
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,989
White gypsum. Charcoal. Flax.

553
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,230
Sichuan Pepper. Sawdust.

554
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,270
They are all for anticorrosion.

555
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:42,169
The body should be preserved here by someone deliberately.

556
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,550
Deliberately?

557
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,380
Did Sir Witch Doctor do it?

558
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,360
What for?

559
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:08,960
It's iron stick for furnace lining.

560
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:14,020
It'll be rainy later.

561
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,020
Let's take the corpse in.

562
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,449
All right. Chu He. Please help us.

563
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,550
Don't move. Let Chu Chu do it.

564
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,369
I'm the coroner of Guanling County.

565
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,090
Let me do it.

566
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,849
You just drunk and are not awake now.

567
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,449
You even can't control yourself in front of your senior.

568
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:59,570
How can I trust you that you can perform duties as a coroner?

569
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,610
Brother, I can do it.

570
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:07,480
Chu Chu. Do it.

571
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:28,449
[Domestic Service]

572
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:29,679
A tag of Palace Domestic Service.

573
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,580
Palace Domestic Service?

574
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,990
[Domestic Service]

575
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,390
Why is the belonging of the palace here?

576
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,279
The dead…

577
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,270
What's wrong?

578
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,929
He's neither a man nor a woman.

579
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,770
Neither a man nor a woman?

580
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,819
- Eunuch!
- Eunuch!

581
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,140
Why was there a eunuch here?

582
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,349
The corpse was carefully kept.

583
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:59,660
It looks plump, making it as it hasn't been dead for long.

584
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,180
Actually, he died years ago.

585
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,649
This kind of corpse is called a wet body in our sector.

586
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,280
My grandpa said that before.

587
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,670
This is the first time I see it.

588
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:14,670
Can you check out the cause?

589
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,230
There are several sharp injuries.

590
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,409
The wounds are narrow.

591
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,970
The fatal injury is ripping into its left chest obliquely

592
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:31,550
upward from the 5th rib, and out of its upper left back

593
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,350
after through the heart.

594
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:38,590
The weapon is almost a sharp, cylindric,

595
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,369
hard thing with a tine, like a…

596
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:43,370
Like this.

597
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:45,469
Yes, it's like that.

598
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,070
Oh, no!
