Are you pretending to be a ghost?

00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,580
Since you are here,

10

why don't you go in and take a look?

Don't you see the door locked?

General Leng rewarded it to me.

20
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,900
I was going to clean it up first before bringing you here.

21
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,200
But it's all right you come here first.

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,000
See if there is anything you need and I will buy them for you.

23
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,480
This was my grandpa's mansion.

24
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,520
He gave it to my father.

25
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,780
I was born here.

26
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,840
After I moved to Princess Xiping's mansion,

27
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,589
Grandpa dismissed all his servants

28
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:56,320
and locked the mansion.

29
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,319
After that, he only lived in the hostel when he came back to meet His Majesty.

30
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:03,450
I thought he had sold the mansion.

31
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,910
I didn't expect this place to still remain the same.

32
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,870
I think he was afraid to come back,

33
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,899
to remind himself of my father

34
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:19,769
and the time when our families were living together.

35
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,789
General Leng told me that he left this mansion to you.

36
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:25,269
He hopes you can let him stay here

37
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:27,470
when he comes back to Chang'an next time.

38
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,530
He really wants to come back to his house.

39
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,430
He wants to see you when he comes back

40
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,600
and see that you are living a good life.

41
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,400
Jing Yi, thank you.

42
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,430
I just passed on a message for him.

43
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,410
You don't need to thank me.

44
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,310
When you two were talking, he must've made you drink a lot. Right?

45
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,560
It's no big deal to drink some white liquor for you.

00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,780
I have a solution.

60
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,230
Your Highness, let's get married.

61
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,070
What?

62
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,859
You said you would marry me.

63
00:06:20,859 --> 00:06:22,560
Do you want to take back your words now?

64
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,860
No. Heaven knows that I want to marry you.

65
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,480
But why do you mention this suddenly?

66
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,250
I've thought about it. As long as we get married,

67
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,269
what has been troubling you will be solved then.

68
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:41,330
You are a relative of the emperor, a commandery prince, and a high-ranking official.

69
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,710

73
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,229
Then when those rebels come,

74
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:56,749
we can arrest them without attracting attention.

75
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,039
Chu Chu, I understand that you want to help me.

76
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:02,610
I also want to find a good way

77

to suppress those rebels who sneaked into Chang'an.

78
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,780

Why not?

80
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:16,550
Marrying you as my wife is the beginning of the rest of our lives together.

81
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,900
It's an extremely precious thing to me.

82
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,550
I should have spent more time with you to enjoy our love life.

83
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,189
But I was suspicious of you first,

84
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:30,139
then I got you involved in those dangerous cases

85
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:32,340
and put you in danger again and again.

86
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,850

87

I know you don't blame me.

88

But...

89
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,610
But that's because you are kind and generous.

90
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,630
I can't take that for granted.

91
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,190
I owe it to you.

92
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,570
If our wedding also becomes bait,

93
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,430
it will be unfair to you.

94
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,789

95
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,849
you mean my idea can work. Right?

100

I never felt it was unfair.

101
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,119
If marrying you can help you,

00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:13,399

You are a judge in Tang. And I am a coroner.

107

If we can arrest those rebels on our wedding day,

108
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,820
that can be an auspicious sign.

109
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,890
It forebodes after we get married,

00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:37,210
we can solve every case and win every battle.

Your Highness, I can't bear to see you feel troubled.

113
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,350
So I'm willing to do it.

114
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:56,000

115

Yes.

116
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,830
Since you proposed it to me,

117
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,890
you must have figured out how to do it.

118
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,150
You only asked me to grant you a marriage.

119
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,199
You haven't told me which girl you want to marry.

Do you want me to pick a random girl for you?

121
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,920
I dare not bother, Your Majesty.

122
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,840
I have someone I like.

00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,510

126
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,650
I beg Your Majesty to allow me to marry Chu Chu,

00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,930
Xiao Jinyu, you are telling me you want to marry a coroner as your wife?

133
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,610
Don't forget your identity.

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,690
I am Tang's official and Your Majesty's courtier.

135
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,799
Then forget about such a disgraceful thing!

136
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,539
Your Majesty, you once praised her

Now I want to marry a woman you appreciate,

139
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,200
why is it a disgraceful matter?

140
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:27,450
Can you marry all the women I appreciate?

141
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:31,319

Not to mention you want to marry her as your wife,

147
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,650
even if you want to take her as your concubine,

148
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,299
it's still against etiquette.

149
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,909
You are in charge of the Three Judicial Offices.

150
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,330
Do you need me to teach you etiquette?

Your Majesty.

152
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:00,120
Xiao Jinyu, don't tell me the nonsense that you are in love.

153
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,149
I've also been at your age.

A young man like you can only see the romance.

155
00:11:06,469 --> 00:11:11,259
Do you know why marriage has always been an important thing since ancient times?

156
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:12,910
That's because after getting married,

157
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,350
you will share your joys and sorrows, glory and shame together.

158
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,990
You will sink or swim with her.

159
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:24,049
Have you ever thought about sharing weal or woe with a coroner?

160
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:25,789
Have you really thought it through for her?

161
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:30,439
With her status, how should she live with herself among those noble ladies?

162
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:35,309
Do you think our ancestors laid down etiquette just because of a momentary inspiration?

163
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:40,829
These are the lessons they learned and summarized after their painful experiences.

164
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,900
Since these lessons came from their experiences,

165
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,880
if I may be so bold as to ask Your Majesty,

166
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,699
did these people ever regret when they were suffering?

167
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:59,810
If they did, did they regret marrying the one they love

168
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:04,150
or failing to keep the promise and treat each other as before?

169
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,240
How dare you!

170
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,899
Your Majesty, since there are lessons from our predecessors,

171
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,750
I will remind myself all the time not to repeat their mistakes.

172
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,689
I hope you can allow me to marry her.

173
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:16,010
Well, Xiao Jinyu.

174
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,489
They all said you were young by prudence.

175
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:23,370
I didn't expect you to act like a child in this matter.

176

Never mind.

00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,260
[Certificate of Coroner]

181
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,759
It was really hard for you to get the certificate issued by
[Certificate of Coroner]

182
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,910
the Ministry of Personnel and the Three Judicial Offices.

183
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,070
I know how important it is to you.

184
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:59,100
Therefore, Chu Chu, I can't marry you now.

185
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,680
Your Highness, you wanted to give up your title to be with me. Right?

186
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,829
If we want to arrest the rebels, we have to make sacrifices. Right?

187
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:18,810
Then, why can't it be me?

188
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:25,280
Everything you've got now is the result of your own efforts.

189
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,990
You put in a lot more effort than I did.

190
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,900
Don't worry. I can figure out another solution.

191
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,470
That will be too late.

192
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,790
- There is no better way than this.
- Chu Chu.

193
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:42,379
Your Highness, the identity of the coroner is important to me indeed.

194
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:45,190
I tried really hard to become a formal coroner

195
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:49,260
not because I want to hold the certificate in my hand,

196
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,850
but because I want to be like my grandfather, my father, my brother

197
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,510
and the constable in Prince Consort's story.

198
00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:00,539
I want to be qualified to eradicate evil people and get justice done.

199
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,300
If giving up my identity as a coroner

200
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:09,019
can wipe out those rebels in one fell swoop and save the people in Tang,

201
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:11,130
then I would rather give it up.

202
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,670
Please allow me to do it.

203
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,310
Chu Chu is the descendant of a loyal general.

204
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:25,579
Your father had been trying to exonerate the Military Commissioner of Jiannan until his death.

205
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:30,390
You brought the evidence all the way back to Chang'an to reveal the truth.

206
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,839
In this way, you do have some sort of connection with the Yun family.

207
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,939
Marrying Yun Yi's daughter as your wife

208
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,649
can be a consolation to those loyal martyrs.

209
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:41,200
You deserve to be praised.

210
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,220
It does make a good story.

211
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:50,170
Xiao Jinyu, if you insist on marrying Chu Chu,

212
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,220
I can grant you two a marriage.

213
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,440
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty!

214
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,499
It's rare for us to hang out together.

215
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,220
The sugar figure is the best in the Western market.

216
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,920
Let me buy one for you.

217
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,740
Sir, I'll have one.

218
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,879
Here. Take it.

219
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:24,630
Long live Duke Chang! Long live Duke Chang!

220
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,750
Jing Yi, look there.

221
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,950
Long live Duke Chang! Long live Duke Chang!

222
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,420
We are from the Court of Judicial Review.

223
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,539
There are words on his clothes.
[Duke Chang retakes the stolen country]

224
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:40,730
Yeah.

225
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,809
It's a miracle!

226
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:43,499
What's written on it?

227
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,140
[Duke Chang retakes the stolen country]

228
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,839
It must be a miracle from Heaven.

229
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,039
Yeah. It's amazing. That's impressive.

230
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,949
How did Commandery Prince An know that there would be people playing tricks in a crowded place in Chang'an

231
00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:03,409
and making these strange things related to Duke Chang?

232
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:06,590
Chen Sheng and Wu Guang hid a message in a fish at the end of the Qin Dynasty.

233
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,610
It's an old trick used by our ancestors,
[Duke Chang retakes the stolen country]

234
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,900
but also a necessary step to rise in rebellion.

235
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,140
That's how they buy people's hearts.

236
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,699
Commandery Prince An knows that Xue Rucheng wouldn't miss this step.

237
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:23,329
It's aconitum. He died of poison.

238
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:27,799
But the words on him really came out of nowhere.

239
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,029
That's pretty strange.

240
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,819
It's not strange at all. It's a little trick of a juggler.

241
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:34,810
Juggler?

242
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,760
The gift for Xiao Jinyu has been prepared.

243
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,810
You only need to make the order.

244
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,420
Go ahead.

245
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,490
Yes.

246
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,220
[The Imperial City]

247
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,410
Wait!

248
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,890
What's this?

249
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,590
Open it.

250
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,770
- Your Highness.
- Calm down. Wu Jiang told me

251
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,589
that someone threw Xu Rugui on the street behind the Three Judicial Offices. Right?

252
00:17:39,589 --> 00:17:41,709
Yes. General Wu was afraid that I would get hurt.

253
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,460
He wouldn't let me see Xu.

254
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,479
I've checked the ruts at the gate.

255
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:47,229
I found some moist lees.

256
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,419
It might be a carriage of a distillery in the city.

257
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:51,120
Distillery?

258
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,380
Your Highness, Xu Rugui is awake.

259
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,720
Your Highness.

260
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,480
Did Xu Rugui go to the Three Judicial Offices?

261
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,990
Yes. Please rest assured.

262
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,520
The plan is perfect.

263
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:14,140
By the way, Xiao Jinyu asked the emperor to grant him a marriage.

264
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,330
He will get married two days later.

265
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,099
The emperor, the royal family members, and the ministers

266
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:22,430
will all attend the wedding at Princess Xiping's mansion.

267
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,710
Who will he marry? That coroner?

268
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,820
Yes.

269
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,900
I heard that in order to marry Xiao Jinyu,

270
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,760
that girl gave up being a coroner.

271
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:40,050
I thought she was an aspiring woman.

272
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,810
Looks like everyone will make the same choice

273
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,590
in the face of wealth.

274
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:51,840
But this time, it's not up to her to be a coroner or not.

275
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,420
Of course.

276
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,450
Everything is under your control.

277
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,580
Where's Zhou Han?

278
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,190
He went off on the errand you gave him.

279
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,430
Send someone to keep an eye on him.

280
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:10,280
He is an unfaithful slave and an opportunist.

281
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,900
He is totally unreliable.

282
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,550
Yes.

283
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,479
He seems to have been frightened.

284
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:31,039
He is barely conscious and very weak.

285
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,030
He also has a fever.

286
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,760
Save me. Save me.

287
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,760
Be quiet.

288
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,879
I didn't handcuff you because you look weak.

289
00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:44,790
- Don't handcuff me...
- You won't be this comfortable if you don't stay quiet.

290
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:48,240
Don't... I'll be quiet.

291
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:52,329
Your Highness, it doesn't look like he caught a cold.

292
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:54,429
If he has some wounds that weren't treated properly,

293
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:57,809
he might die if the injury gets worse.

294
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,660
Wu Jiang, hold him down.

295
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,160
Go ahead.

296
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,510
Chu Chu, save me. Chu Chu, save me.

297
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,660
Don't move. I'll just check your wound.

298
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,730
Xu Rugui, look at me.

299
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,189
I'll ask you a few questions.

300
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,520
Think carefully before you answer me.

301
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,509
Only in this way can I know how to save you.

302
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:31,589
Do you understand me?

303
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:33,950
Yes. Yes.

304
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,659
Your Highness, something went wrong.

305
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,219
Jing Yi exposed our miracle in public at the Western market.

306
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,450
Long live Duke Chang!

307
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,940
[Duke Chang retakes the stolen country]

308
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,640
What's going on?

309
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,870
It's a little trick of a juggler.

310
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,440
Juggler?

311
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,980
[Liquor Vinegar]

312
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,740
What is he doing?

313
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,320
What does he want to do?

314
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,380
What is he doing?

315
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,260
I can't tell.

316
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,850
I just smelled lime on him.

317
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,419
Lime generates heat when exposed to water.

318
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,220
He just played a trick of hiding the words with vinegar.

319
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,660
Come on, let me show it to you.

320
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,190
Leng Yue.

321
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,430
What?

322
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,620
Pour the lime on me.

323
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,410
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

324
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,129
He imitated us and used vinegar to write.

325
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,919
Lime generates heat when exposed to water.

326
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,489
He used it to warm the clothes and make the words show up.

327
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,130
Look. There are words! The words are showing up!

328
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,629
He wrote a love poem.
[Wish to win one's heart]

329
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,639
Everyone is all talking about his romance.

330
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,560
No one cares about the words we left.

331
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,929
The so-called miracle is not a crucial factor,

332
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,540
but the icing on the cake.

333
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,629
It's just like when Chen Sheng and Wu Guang spread rumors through fish and fox,

334
00:22:05,629 --> 00:22:08,750
and Empress Wu Zetian used stone to buy people's hearts.

335
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,289
After I kill the tyrant and ascend the throne as the rightful emperor,

336
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,420
the people in Chang'an will know

337
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,210
how they have been deceived over the years.

338
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:20,829
Give them my order.

339
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:22,879
Make this loyalist Marquis Zhongyi.

340
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:24,259
Treat his wife and children generously.

341
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,560
Yes!

342
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,500
Everything is ready now.

343
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:34,070
Let them keep struggling for a while.

344
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,419
After the hourglass runs out,

345
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,819
take your place and let's wait to catch turtles in the pot.

346
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:46,710
I swear allegiance to Your Highness.

347
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,699
Do you know who left you at the gate of the Three Judicial Offices?

348
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,849
I don't know.

349
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,460
On my way back from Qianzhou,

350
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,560
I was abducted by bandits.

351
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:04,100
When I woke up, I found myself in Chang'an already.

352
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:09,400
They kept me in several different places.

353
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,230
But they covered my head every time.

354
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,080
I don't know who they are

355
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,020
and where I have been.

356
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,310
If you don't know where they kept you,

357
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:28,200
how did you know that you were in Chang'an?

358
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,580
There were drums.

359
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,520
There were drums at dawn.

360
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,030
Drums at dawn in Chang'an.

361
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,690
Did you hear any other special sound?

362
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:43,069
Or did you smell anything special?

363
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,320
Smell...

364
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:51,100
I smelled... liquor.
[Liquor]

365
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,049
I smelled lees.

366
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,750
Is it a tavern?

367
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,930
It's not a tavern.

368
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,000
I ran a tavern before.

369
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,870
They are lees.

370
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:06,810
The smell of lees from a distillery.

371
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,519
What else?

372
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,320
And... when I went out,

373
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,730
I heard someone yelling...

374
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,100
Charcoal!

375
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,059
Good. Keep thinking.

376
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:25,279
What food did they give you during this time?

377
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,030
Was there any food that you are familiar with?

378
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,139
Like you ate before in a restaurant in Chang'an

379
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,559
or at the stall in the street?

380
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,000
They... They only gave me

381
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,280
pickles and steamed buns.

382
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,070
And water.

383
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:46,789
And a lot of medicine.

384
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:48,390
Medicine?

385
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,760
Were they treating you?

386
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,740
I don't know. It's just medicine.

387
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,389
It's really bitter. A lot of medicine.

388
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:01,329
They made me take medicine every day.

389
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:04,480
When I didn't want to take it, they just poured it down me.

390
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,970
Good. Good.

391
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,499
What else can you remember?

392
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,659
Any detail.

393
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,789
Whatever you've seen, heard, smelled, tasted.

394
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:12,610
Anything you felt.

395
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,270
Before I went out this time,

396
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,840
they didn't give me steamed buns.

397
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,310
What?

398
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:25,930
They made me eat a ball.

399
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,529
But they wouldn't let me bite it.

400
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:32,060
I swallowed it down. It was big.

401
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,780
To prevent me from biting it,

402
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:39,350
they grabbed me by the mouth and shoved it in.

403
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:42,990
Shoved it in... Shoved it in...

404
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:46,580
The ball... The ball...

405
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,659
Your Highness.

406
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,439
There are only a few stab wounds on him caused by fighting with others.

407
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:54,800
The wounds are not infected.

408
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,990
But it's so weird.

409
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,750
He doesn't show any symptoms of wind chill.

410
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:04,840
Theoretically, he shouldn't have a fever for no reason.

411
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:10,180
Xu Rugui, did you have the fever before you ate the ball?

412
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,940
No.

413
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,580
I got in the carriage,

414
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,320
the carriage was swaying

415
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,680
and I started to feel sick... sick...

416
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:28,160
Your Highness, what's going on?

417
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,500
- You guys.
- Yes!

418
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,910
Keep an eye on him. Don't let him move.

419
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,309
Pay attention to his condition.

420
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:36,949
Let me know immediately if anything goes wrong.

421
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,350
Yes!

422
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,329
Help me... Help me...

423
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,719
I plead guilty.

424
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:46,420
Help me...

425
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,660
[Chang'an]

426
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,340
Your Highness, what's this?

427
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,480
Xu Rugui must've been sent by Xue Rucheng.

428
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,809
He took Xu Rugui captive

429
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,019
to make Qin Luan work for him.

430
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,750
Now Qin Luan is dead.

431
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,200
Xu Rugui is useless for him now.

432
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,509
He was supposed to kill Xu Rugui.

433
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,460
But now he sent Xu Rugui here alive.

434
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,470
He must be up to something.

435
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,600
Wu Jiang, pass my order down quickly.

436
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,059
Ask those who went out

437
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,579
to report back to me all the information they gathered.

438
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:30,990
I want every detail. You must hurry.

439
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,820
Yes.

440
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,130
I am back.

441
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,710
What's this?

442
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:43,569
This is the miracle Xue Rucheng showed at the Western market.

443
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:46,599
Aconitum with the trick of the juggler.

444
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,619
It's really perfunctory.

445
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,559
- Where is that person?
- He has been sent to the autopsy room.

446
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:56,019
Your Highness, I heard that Xu Rugui was left at the gate of Three Judicial Offices.

447
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:59,039
- Is he still alive?
- It's a little troublesome.

448
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,060
Leng Yue, I need you to take a look at Xu Rugui.

449
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,519
What's the situation?

450
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,039
Chu Chu will tell you the details.

451
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,079
- Okay.
- Okay.

452
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,300
Your Highness, this is all the news we found today.

453
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,060
[Ancestral Hall of the Xiao Family]

454
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,300
Ancestral Hall of the Xiao Family?

455
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,050
- Ancestral Hall?
- Yes.

456
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,979
Our person who went to follow Zhou Han today reported back

457
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,129
that Zhou Han showed up around the Ancestral Hall of the Xiao Family with some men.

458
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:40,269
- They were sneaky. Looks like they were...
- ...casing the joint?
- Right, casing the joint.

459
00:28:40,269 --> 00:28:42,659
Casing the joint? Why would they case the joint at that place?

460
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:44,999
There are only the spirit tablets of your ancestors.

461
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,329
Even if Xue Rucheng was pissed off by you,

462
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:52,119
he wouldn't vent his anger by destroying your family's ancestral hall at such a critical time.

463
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,480
How is it?

464
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:11,329
It looks like symptoms of being poisoned by a small amount of castor bean.

465
00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:13,299
From his condition now,

466
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,199
he will have a fever and nausea at most.

467
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:17,829
Even if he doesn't take any medicine, he won't die.

468
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:22,929
Did Xue Rucheng send him here just to let us see him suffer?

469
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,300
What kind of trick is this?

470
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,759
Does Xue Rucheng want to use him to stall us

471
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:30,080
so that we can't find out his plan?

472
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,780
I don't know.

473
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,500
I don't know anything.

474
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,060
I really don't know.

475
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,950
Let's talk outside.

476
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,400
What did you call Xu Rugui?

477
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,420
A weapon?

478
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,949
I'm afraid he can't even hold a spoon now.

479
00:29:59,949 --> 00:30:02,520
What kind of weapon can he be?

480
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,350
Do you remember I said

481
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,520
that Xue Rucheng is waiting for a chance?

482
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,450
Sending Xu Rugui here should be a chance he made.

483
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:20,169
Is it the chance that can gather the royal family members and the important officials?

484
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:21,770
That's right.

485
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,809
What are you talking about?

486
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,870
Why can't I understand your words?

487
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:30,659
Your Highness, what do you think Xue Rucheng sent Xu Rugui to the Three Judicial Offices to do?

488
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,410
To kill me.

489
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,190
I got it.

490
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,859
If you are killed because of this,

491
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,529
the emperor will highly commend you.

492
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,370
Plus the case of Prince Consort,

493
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,539
in order to comfort Princess Xiping and Xiao Jinli,

494
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,449
he will bring his family members and the courtiers

495
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,190
to visit the Xiao family's ancestral hall in person.

496
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,330
That's the chance Xue Rucheng wants to create.

497
00:30:55,330 --> 00:31:00,009
That's why you said Zhou Han showed up around the ancestral hall to case the joint.

498
00:31:00,009 --> 00:31:03,110
They are frantic indeed.

499
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,049
I won't allow him to hurt you. I'll tie him up now!

500
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:07,420
Come back.

501
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,480
It's not that simple.

502
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:14,809
I don't know what exactly Xue Rucheng did to Xu Rugui,

503
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:18,910
but the key must be the ball he fed him.

504
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:22,140
Your Highness, do you suspect that the ball is poisonous?

505
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,940
Do you remember how Xu Rugui described the way he ate the ball?

506
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,050
They wanted him to swallow it.

507
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:32,749
They didn't let him chew it or give him any water.

508
00:31:32,749 --> 00:31:36,549
I suspect that there is something inside the ball.

509
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:38,990
Now he is digesting the outer layer.

510
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,899
After the outer layer is completely digested,

511
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,590
it's hard to tell what's inside.

512
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,860
No matter what it is, the top priority is to send Xu Rugui away as far as possible.

513
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,859
Yeah, Your Highness. Jing Yi is right!

514
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,320
The top priority is to send Xu Rugui away.

515
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,969
Your Highness, even if it's a bomb inside the ball that will explode,

516
00:31:58,969 --> 00:32:01,179
as long as it doesn't hurt anyone when it blows up,

517
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,430
Xue Rucheng's trick...

518
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,680
Chu Chu, it's a life-and-death matter.

519
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,680
We can't have it both ways.

520
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,700
Your Highness, can I have a try?

521
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,899
Try what?

522
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,380
I want to take the ball out

523
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,929
before its outer layer is digested.

524
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:29,499
You want to cut Xu Rugui open alive?

525
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,619
No.

526
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,179
I just want to take that thing out

527
00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:35,529
like treating a patient.

528
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:38,279
But, Chu Chu, a living person is not like a dead man.

529
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:40,409
Not to mention Xu Rugui is really weak now.

530
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,910
We don't know if he can take it.

531
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:46,330
And… he is your uncle.

532
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,030
What if...

533
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,609
Your Highness, Xu Rugui is a criminal wanted by the imperial court.

534
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,179
Whether he is dead or alive,

535
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,590
it should be determined by the law of the court.

536
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:58,260
He shouldn't be manipulated by Xue Rucheng.

537
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,939
If he died from that ball,

538
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,609
whether it hurts anyone or not, the winner will still be Xue Rucheng.

539
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,009
If I cut him open and take out the ball,

540
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,020
disrupt their conspiracy and bring them to justice,

541
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,000
then the winner will be us.

542
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:14,230
Your Highness, I would like to help Chu Chu.

543
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,360
Leng Yue, it's too dangerous.

544
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:25,059
Your Highness, I think Chu Chu has a point.

545
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,249
She knows the structure of the human body very well.

546
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,619
I know some medical skills.

547
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,839
With my help, the chances of keeping him alive are bigger.

548
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,440
Thank you, Miss Leng.

549
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,800
Your Highness.

550
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,330
I don't know what to do with you.

551
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,820
Go and return quickly.

552
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,549
I've asked His Majesty to grant us a marriage.

553
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,209
We will get married a few days later.

554
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,069
There are still many things to prepare.

555
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:56,240
Okay, I will prepare it now.

556
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,780
Wu Jiang.

557
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,139
Ask someone to carry Xu Rugui to the autopsy room.

558
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,810
- Follow Chu Chu and Leng Yue's orders.
- Yes.

559
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:10,779
What's more, leave ten guards at the Ten-Commandment Hall and strictly guard the courtyard.

560
00:34:10,779 --> 00:34:12,939
Leave two guards at the door of the autopsy room

561
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,139
to act in concert with Chu Chu and Leng Yue anytime.

562
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,759
The rest of them should all leave.

563
00:34:16,759 --> 00:34:20,029
No one is allowed to approach the Ten-Commandment Hall without my order.

564
00:34:20,029 --> 00:34:21,340
Yes!

565
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:26,800
Jing Yi, you should leave too.

566
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,800
Your Highness, you are all here. Where can I go?

567
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,960
I don't care. No matter what kind of danger it is,

568
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,169
I will be with you all.

569
00:34:34,169 --> 00:34:36,640
I'm going to support Chu Chu and Leng Yue.

570
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,640
The anesthesia powder is ready.

571
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,330
Let me do it.

[Map of Chang'an]

573
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,000
The rebels are hiding in various places in Chang'an.

574
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,909
Xue Rucheng knows that I'm back in Chang'an.

575
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,750
He dare not move around right now.

576
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,059
Xu Rugui is an important bargaining chip of his.

[Guangde]

578
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,999
He had to keep him under his nose to feel at ease.

The charcoal seller. Lees.

582
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:49,490
A distillery that a charcoal seller passes by.

583
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:52,530
A place where the dawn drum can be heard.

584
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,920
It should be near the Drum Tower.

585
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,289
The deceased who took poison and faked the miracle at the Western market

586
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,470
had oil stains on his cuffs.

587
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,900
He had bisquits before he died

588
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,750
- Take it.
- Thank you.

589
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:11,559
There are shavings used to absorb moisture in the container under his soles,

590
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:16,350
which means he went to a warehouse for storing valuable goods.

where the dead who faked the miracle might go before his death.
[Xue Mansion]
[Wonton]

596
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,949
The red line marks the possible last place where Xu Rugui was kept.

597
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:50,160
Give me something to eat, sir.

598
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,449
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Go away.

599
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:53,099
The gathering place of the rebels must be in the area

where the three lines intersect.
[Fengle]

601
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,970

- Yes.

00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,489
send someone to Princess Xiping's mansion and ask Jinli to come here.

Yes.
