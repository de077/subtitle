disguised as candidates.
[We can't meet as scheduled.]

With the help of Zhenyuan Escort,
[Jinguang Gate]

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,390
Jinli and Leng Yue attracted the attention of the eunuchs.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,040
Then we returned to Chang'an in secret as planned.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,690
Hope we can prevent their plot.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,640
[It goes well. Stick to the plan.]

I think you know why
[Princess Xiping's Mansion]

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,419
Heng went to the base of

12
00:00:46,419 --> 00:00:49,320
the military commissioner in Jiannan at that time.

13
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,790
Not only do I know it, the kids all know it.

14
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,940
Your Grace, there was an unborn child in Chang'an

15
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,240
about the age of your unborn child.

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,469
There were many reasons why you had to conceal his identity.

17
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:10,269
I guess the child you adopted in secret

18
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:13,970
is the child of Chen Ying's wife.

19
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,149
Qin Luan tracked down your former maids.

20
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:18,780
He wants to use the kid to make waves.

21
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,130
Your Grace, you have to tell me the truth.

22
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,350
Then I can figure out a solution to help the kids out.

23
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:31,730
Otherwise, it will be too late.

24
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,589
- Well...
- Your Grace.

25
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,990
This is...

26
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,530
Where's Mrs. Chen?

27
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,710
She took a drug to induce labor.

28
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,249
The blood wouldn't stop after she gave birth to the boy.

29
00:01:51,249 --> 00:01:54,700
She's passed away.

30
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,420
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,889
Madam asked me to tell you something before she died.

00:01:58,889 --> 00:02:00,559
When Master returned to Chang'an to report on his work,

33
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:02,610
he was excited about having a child.

34
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,529
He would never rebel right after returning to the Southwest.

35
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:06,640
For the sake of your friendship with Madam,

36
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,560
please make the bloodline of the Chen clan last.

37
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,430
We dare not ask you to clear the name of the Chen clan.

38
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,550
But please save their son's life.

39
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,310
Your Grace.

40
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,710

[Episode 32]

43
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,179
Master, the time is up.

44
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,520
There is no military report from the Southwest.

45
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,910
Really?

46
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,979
No news at all?

47
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,139
Right. Should we act on the plan?

48
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,650
Hold on.

49
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,960
General Zhou.

50
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,890
Who are in the carriage?

51
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,039
The girls we sent out last night to drink with our customers.

52
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,899
We are just bringing them back.

53
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,770
- Are there any newcomers?
- Yes.

54
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,270
- Let me take a look.
- Go ahead.

55
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,319
General Zhou, do you still remember me?

56
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,720
I really miss you.

57
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,850
Yes, your name is Cuixiang.

58
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,790
Move yourself. Let me take a look at the newcomers.

59
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,590
Give me a smile.

60
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,870
Great.

61
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,880
Sit tight.

62
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,310
Go.

63
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,330
General Zhou, you are welcome to visit us.

64
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,460
Thanks, girls.

65
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,080
You are welcome, Mr. Jing.

66
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,550
General Zhou, nothing suspicious.

67
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,140
What are these?

68
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,640
Sir, these are fresh foods for Guangtai House. It's a long trip.

69
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,429
To keep the foods fresh, we use ice to keep them cold.

70
00:06:12,429 --> 00:06:16,240
You just saw it. We prepared ice cubes for this trip.

71
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,490
Zhenyuan Escort even started to deliver fresh foods.

72
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,899
It's a difficult time to make a living now.

73
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:27,740
We are glad that our old clients hired us.

74
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,999
Thank you for guarding the city.

75
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,400
Have a drink and relax yourself when you have time.

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,409
- Thank you, Sir.
- Hurry up.

78
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:40,900
Go.

92
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,920
- Master...
- Mr. Xue.

93
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,100
General Wu.

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,510
Commandery Prince An.

95
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,450
Why are you...?

96
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,050
Where is Mr. Xue?

97
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,340
Master is...

98
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,370
Your Highness, you're late.

99
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,870
- Master...
- It's impossible.

100
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,430
Your Highness.

101
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,310
It's impossible.

102
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,690
Your Highness.

103
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,260
When the study was on fire, we were all sleeping.

104
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,029
The person on night watch slacked off and didn't notice the fire in time.

105
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:52,960
It was already too late when we noticed the fire.

106
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,610
Your Highness, you don't want to look at him.

107
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,140
Master is unrecognizable now.

108
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,219
He definitely doesn't want to meet you in this way. Your Highness.

109
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:13,890
I made the order not to tell anyone

110
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,280
when I came to visit my teacher.

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,920
Did you forget that?

112
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,390
I dare not.

113
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,830
I don't believe it.

114
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,010
I don't believe he just died.

115
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,040
- Chu Chu.
- Your Highness.

116
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,579
I want to know what my teacher went through before he died.

117
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,210
And...

118
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,360
if there is anything he wanted to say.

119
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,739
Okay.

120
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:07,200
Your Highness, you...

121
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,740
Master... Master!

122
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,810
Master...

123
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,330
Master...

124
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,870
Master... Master...

125
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,320
Jing Yi, look at the bolt.

126
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,070
The door must have been broken from the outside.

127
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,030
Are you sure?

128
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,449
I've broken more doors than any windows you have ever jumped out of.

129
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:15,150
How can I be wrong?

130
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:23,449
Do you mean Minister Xue didn't get out of the fire before he fainted because of the smoke?

131
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,010
Wu Jiang.

132
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,010
Here.

133
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,480
Your Highness, stop looking at it.

134
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,320
I don't believe he would be so careless.

135
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,770
He was never a careless person.

136
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,710
If there was a fire outside, there is no way he wouldn't have noticed it.

137
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,590
He let himself be burned to death.

138
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,660
If that's the case, there must be some reason.

139
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,930
You suspect he was murdered?

140
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,280
He died just as I came back to Chang'an.

141
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,710
How can there be such a coincidence?

142
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,539
But we came back in secret.

143
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,189
The people who know that we are back are only my father and Wu Jiang.

144
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,349
Who would kill Minister Xue at this time?

145
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,029
Why would they kill Minister Xue?

146
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:26,630
Calm down.

147
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,640
I know it's hard to accept.

148
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,770
But this might just be an accident.

149
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,960
The fire didn't start from one place.

150
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,249
There was a fire source outside the house, and also a fire source inside the house.

151
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,449
Look at the pillar.

152
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:11,119
It looks black at first glance.

153
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:13,120
But if you take a closer look,

154
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,320
you can find the smoke marks vary in shades

155
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,140
and are branch-like.

156
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,510
You are right.

157
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,940
That's how you find the fire source.

158
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,959
The darkest place is the source of the fire.

159
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,490
It should be this brazier.

160
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,180
The comburent was placed in this brazier.

161
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:52,060
This fire is definitely not an accident.

162
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,460
Your Highness, since this person set a fire outside the house,

163
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:01,139
why would the person bother to set another fire inside the house to cover it up?

164
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:02,880
I think the person set a fire

165
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,350
in the study to fully burn the house

166
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,320
and burn as many things as possible.

167
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,220
And also...

168
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,180
Your Highness, come here!

169
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,480
Your Highness.

170
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,610
- Chu Chu.
- Your Highness, he is not Mr. Xue.

171
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,519
What?

172
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,520
He is not Mr. Xue.

173
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,660
Chu Chu, you only met Mr. Xue a few times.

174
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,610
Are you really sure it's not him?

175
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,750
Yes.

176
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,289
The figure of this person is very similar to that of Mr. Xue.

177
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:51,510
But it can be judged from the teeth wear
[Tooth wear]

178
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,310
that this person was in his early twenties at most.
[About 20]

179
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,749
He is definitely not Mr. Xue.

180
00:13:55,749 --> 00:13:59,959
Besides, his skin curled up and there is no pus or blisters.

181
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:02,179
There are marks of strangulation on his neck.

182
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,649
His hyoid is also broken.
[Marks of strangulation on the neck]

183
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,939
He was not burned to death.
[Broken hyoid]

184
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,610
He was strangled alive and then burned by fire.

185
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,979
How is it possible?

186
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,680
If he is not Master, why was he in Master's study?

187
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,680
Where did Master go then?

188
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,040
Who is he?

189
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,120
[Token]

190
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,280
Why do you have the...

191
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,609
access token of the Ministry of War?

192
00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:29,859
Master worried that he would forget to take it,

193
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,379
so he always gave it to me when he came back and let me keep it.

194
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:35,680
I would give it to him before he left.

195
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,410
It's weird. How could there be such a thing?

196
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,560
What's wrong?

197
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,239
Your Highness, look at this.

198
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,529
There is Snake Killer.

199
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,730
- Snake Killer?
- What's that?

200
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,780
Your Highness, smell it.

201
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,419
It's fragrant.

202
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:05,079
Yes, this herb emits fragrance when it's blooming.

203
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:07,180
People feel refreshed when they smell it.

204
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,640
But snakes will hide away when they smell it.

205
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,639
This herb can repel snakes and detoxify snake venom.

206
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,289
It works much better than herbs for detoxifying snake venom like lobelia.

207
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:20,859
But there are few snakes in the courtyards of Chang'an.

208
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:23,210
Why would Mr. Xue grow this kind of herb?

209
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,849
Not just here. There and over there.

210
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:28,399
It was planted in several places in this yard.

211
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,870
I guess there is Snake Killer in other yards.

212
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,519
Is that true?

213
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,620
Yes, Master asked us to grow it.

214
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,670
I don't know what kind of herb it is.

215
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,310
That's weird.

216
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,840
I never heard that Mr. Xue was so afraid of snakes.

217
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,060
Your Highness, did Mr. Xue ever live in the Southwest?

218
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,710
Why do you ask that?

219
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,249
People in the Southwest will grow

220
00:15:55,249 --> 00:15:56,709
a few Snake Killer in front of and behind the house

221
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,349
and also near the barn no matter if they are afraid of snakes or not.

222
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,900
When the people around all grow it,

223
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,309
if someone doesn't grow it, the snake will go to his place.

224
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:05,439
I grow the plant at my place.

225
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,669
It was also planted in the backyard of the Guanling County Office.

226
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,890
But it really looks like a weed.

227
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,969
And it's usually planted in unremarkable places under the wall.

228
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:15,910
Your Highness, you never noticed it. Right?

229
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,980
You mean even if you live in Chang'an,

230
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,029
knowing that there are no snakes in Chang'an,

231
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,850
you will still grow Snake Killer.

232
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,810
Yes.

233
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,629
I grew up watching every household grow it since I was a kid.

234
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:31,150
I know the snakes won't come when I see it.

235
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,669
If I don't see it in the place where I live in,

236
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,220
especially in the season when snakes and insects are widespread in the Southwest,

237
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,810
I'll still feel uneasy though I know

238
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,190
that there are no snakes in Chang'an.

239
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:47,020
But Mr. Xue is a native of Chang'an.

240
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,669
Mr. Xue, have you ever heard that Minister Xue

241
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:53,310
ever lived in the Southwest?

242
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,200
No.

243
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,249
- Wu Jiang.
- Your Highness.

244
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:00,829
- Send Chu Chu back to the Three Judicial Offices.
- Yes.

245
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:03,330
Jing Yi, come with me.

246
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,340
[Office of the Ministry of War]

247
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,240
Who are you?

248
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,609
We are from the Three Judicial Offices.
[Token]

249
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:19,610
Please.

250
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,000
Your Highness, what are you looking for?

251
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,810
Your Highness?

252
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,290
Your Highness...

253
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,590
It's really him.

254
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,070
Who?

255
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,910
Who's him? Who are you talking about?

256
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,360
This is the memorial of the Ministry of War, right?

257
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,980
"Rebels in Qianzhou attempted to seize the base?"

258
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,360
This is what happened at the base of the military commissioner.

259
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,030
What's wrong?

260
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,550
According to the rules, the military report will be

261
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,329
sent to the Ministry of War first.

262
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,779
Then he will draw up a memorial

263
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:59,700
and present it to the emperor with the military report.

264
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,110
That's right.

265
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,710
The memorial is here. Where is the report?

266
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,700
The report...

267
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,720
I sspecially told General Leng to block the message.

268
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,109
The military report must be presented by Jinli to the court in person.

269
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,820
Jinli and the military report are still on the way.

270
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,410
How could Minister Xue know it in advance?

271
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:29,230
Without the military report, except us,

272
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,530
the only person who can be so familiar with the situation

273
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,970
is the so-called Duke Chang.

274
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:41,269
He wrote such a memorial in advance and left it in the Ministry of War to...

275
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,300
To be prepared in both ways.

276
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,770
Uprising and seizing the base are of great importance.

277
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,420
Zhao Jie must have discussed with him in advance.

278
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,200
Ten days from the day of seizing the base

279
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,611
is the latest day that the urgent military report arrives in Chang'an,

280
00:19:57,611 --> 00:20:00,060
which is today.

281
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,910
If Zhao Jie wins,

282
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,989
the Ministry of War won't receive the military report.

283
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:06,960
He will get rid of the identity of Xue Rucheng

284
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,070
and raise in rebellion in the name of Duke Chang.

285
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,460
What if Zhao Jie fails?

286
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,000
If Zhao Jie fails,

287
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,180
General Leng will send a military report to the Ministry of War.

288
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,580
The military report is a warning signal.

289
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,949
He carefully drew up a cumbersome memorial in advance.

290
00:20:30,949 --> 00:20:32,729
If he receives the military report,

291
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:36,130
he will present the memorial and cause turmoil in court

292
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:40,599
to get more time for him to handle it and escape.

293
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,069
Today is my rebirth

294
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:51,430
and the day that I become Duke Chang again.

295
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,749
I've endured humiliation and moved carefully for more than ten years.

296
00:20:55,749 --> 00:20:57,579
I hired a killer in Rugui House

297
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,419
and used Qin Luan's people to get rid of

298
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,680
the obstacles on the way to my great cause.

299
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,900
I carefully planted useful people

300
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,760
and I've been planning and preparing.

301
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,760
He used the dancing girl to kill Yan Ming.

302
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,589
I heard from Commandery Prince An that you killed Yan Ming only to steal something.

303
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,020
He wanted to use me to find out why Yan Ming was killed

304
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,759
and whip up the public opinion that Duke Chang is still alive.

305
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:39,441
Then he will lead his troops
[Duke Chang, The royal family]

306
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:40,929
to seize the Southwest,
[Duke Chang, The royal family mystery]

307
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:45,039
press forward to Chang'an and usurp the throne in the name of Duke Chang.

308
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,289
I didn't expect Xiao Jinyu to find out the truth

309
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,770
about the counterfeit money.
[Qian]

310
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,910
If I had more time

311
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:59,059
to fully disperse the counterfeit money among the people,

312
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,710
the government would lose its prestige
[County Office of Qianzhou]

313
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:06,810
and I would win the hearts of the people.

314
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,279
I got rid of Liu Yue, the Minister of Revenue…

315
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:12,379
To cover up the fact that he made counterfeit money in Qianzhou.

316
00:22:12,379 --> 00:22:14,809
I killed Lu Chuansheng, the Capital Liaison Representative in Qianzhou…

317
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,659
to cut off the communication between Qianzhou and the imperial court.

318
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,859
And also the Minister of War, Feng Jie, who went to inspect the Southwest.

319
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,249
Thank you for your reward, Your Majesty.

320
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,299
He intercepted the news that Leng Peishan was seriously ill.
[Map of the Ministry of War]

321
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:27,659
Then he took over the position of the Minister of War.

322
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,619
As the Minister of War,

323
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,920
I can learn the movements of all parties

324
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,290
and carry out the military plan without a sound.

325
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,840
I've taken care of everything.

326
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,409
But Xiao Jinyu suddenly had this female coroner

327
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,329
who found out the truth about the death of Feng Jie and others.

328
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,529
Xiao Jinyu followed the clues

329
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,519
and investigated all the way to Qianzhou.

330
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,929
What I really worry about

331
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:56,519
is the person who hired killers to kill

332
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:58,940
Liu Yue, Lu Chuansheng, and Feng Jie.

333
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,549
Soldiers, money, and news are all abnormal.
[Guanling County, Qianzhou]

334
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,170
They all gather in the Southwest.

335
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,730
If I may be so bold,

336
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,369
this person is up to something big.

337
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:11,731
I'm afraid it might jeopardize the stability of the Southwest of Tang.

338
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:16,800
I should have made them disappear forever in Qianzhou.

339
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,850
He knew that Qin Luan would send people to intercept and kill us.

340
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:23,419
He wanted to reap the benefits.
[Qianzhou]

341
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,699
But it didn't go as I expected.

342
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,829
Xiao Jinli showed up and saved your life temporarily.
[Tang]

343
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,819
He learned I entered Qianzhou alive,
[Tang Chang'an]

344
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,060
then he created an excuse to inspect the Southwest.

345
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,970
I have another thing to do in Qianzhou.
[Jinyu went to Qianzhou]

346
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,340
Among the reports of Minister Feng's inspection of the Southwest,

347
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,999
there is one volume missing.

348
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:48,970
It's fine if he lost it accidentally.

349
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:53,249
But if someone doesn't want me to see the inspection report,

350
00:23:53,249 --> 00:23:55,280
who would be that person?

351
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,880
He led His Majesty to be wary of Leng Peishan.

352
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,899
Then he took the opportunity and volunteered to come to Qianzhou

353
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,470
to cover up his conspiracy.

354
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,680
The wounds on Prefect Li's hands

355
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,369
fit these tools perfectly in terms of shape and size.

356
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:13,180
It's you who made the coin molds!

357
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,119
That useless Li Zhang.

358
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:18,160
He failed to kill Xiao Jinyu again.

359
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,339
He even lost to a female coroner.

360
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,210
What a rebel!

361
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,070
If it weren't for Li Zhang's insanity,

362
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,010
I would have guessed it was him.

363
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:31,000
Fortunately, I was well prepared in the Southwest.

364
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,530
Leng Peishan has been poisoned by cinnabar for a while.

365
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:37,759
Li Zhang used the cover of Qianzhou's soldiers to recruit and train soldiers.

366
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,929
Wu Chen used datura flower to make the soldiers go crazy and neutralize the military.

367
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:43,979
Zhao Jie took the opportunity to seize the base

368
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,199
and then take over the military power in the Southwest in the name of Duke Chang

369
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,490
to help me achieve my great cause.

370
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,580
Right now, he doesn't know Zhao Jie failed.

371
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,180
He thinks everything is going on as he scheduled.

372
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,190
He didn't flee in a hurry tonight.

373
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,000
He followed his plan to prepare for the next step.

374
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,159
I still have an important bargaining chip.

375
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,830
Xu Rugui.

376
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,380
He played a trick to take Xu Rugui away.

377
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,990
Then he learned the secret in my father's suicide letter.

378
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,670
He got Qin Luan's vital point

379
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:19,859
and forced Qin Luan to collude with him.
[Rugui]

380
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:23,629
Duke Chang is willing to join hands with you to kill the tyrant.

381
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,370
I can't believe

382
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:31,560
that I gave Xu Rugui to him in person.

383
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,250
Your Highness, what do you plan to do next?

384
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:43,730
I do not know.

385
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,140
Master, it's not good.

386
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,970
Commandery Prince An and Jing Yi went to the Ministry of War.

387
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,880
Xiao Jinyu is back alive?

388
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,229
Zhou Han is useless indeed.

389
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:13,670
He can do nothing.

390
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,190
Come here.

391
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:22,740
Go to do what I told you before immediately.

392
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,669
The prescription that Doctor Li wrote last time works really well.

393
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:27,560
Yeah.

394
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,329
Isn't Doctor Zhang on duty today?

395
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:32,310
Why is it dark in the room?

396
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:35,420
I remember there was light when we went there.

397
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,360
Why is the door not closed?

398
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,419
Doctor Zhang is old now. Could it be that something happened to him?

399
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,130
Doctor Zhang.

400
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,840
Doctor Zhang, are you inside?

401
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,780
Doctor Zhang!

402
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,500
Save him!

403
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:08,949
General Wu, I heard that Commandery Prince An is back.

404
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,150
I cooked something for him.

405
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,829
Just go back, Miss Chu.

406
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,029
His Highness has been in Thought Chamber since he came back.

407
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:18,239
He told me to guard here and let no one disturb him.

408
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:20,999
But His Highness didn't eat anything on his way here.

409
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:23,479
He will feel uncomfortable if he doesn't eat anything at night.

410
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:27,330
General Wu, I just want to check on him.

411
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,019
I'll leave right after I send him the food.

412
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:30,730
I won't annoy him.

413
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:33,300
Miss Chu, just go back.

414
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,239
I was kicked out by him before I reached the door.

415
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:38,180
Just take my advice.

416
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:41,389
After His Highness finishes his work, I will let you know.

417
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,709
- But...
- Just let Miss Chu in.

418
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:48,639
Otherwise, Miss Chu can't rest at ease.

419
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,070
Thank you, General Wu.

420
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,920
Get out!

421
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,650
Your Highness...

422
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,210
Your Highness, I made some soup for you.

423
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:46,060
Why don't you have some soup first?

424
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,500
I'll have the soup.

425
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,090
It's late.

426
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,980
Go to sleep.

427
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:09,229
♫ If you walk into the rest of my life ♫

428
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:12,969
Your Highness, you traveled day and night,

429
00:29:12,969 --> 00:29:15,240
and hardly had any sleep.

430
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,709
You constantly have stomachaches.

431
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,200
And you don't want to eat anything. You've lost a lot of weight.

432
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:23,519
♫ Spend our lives through time ♫

433
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,559
If you just want to give an explanation to His Majesty,

434
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,249
I can give you Xu Rugui.

435
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:29,609
Xu Rugui?

436
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,260
♫ We're by each other's side ♫

437
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,770
These are the cases I handled before.

438
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,730
Whenever I had difficulties,

439
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,900
I would take them out and read them.

440
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,580
Looking at these souls

441
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,060
who had rested in peace,

442
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,460
and thinking about

443
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,180
those who were still waiting for me to clear their names,

444
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:36,930
no matter how difficult it was,

445
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,050
I would still believe I could take it.

446
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,270
But now...

447
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,910
I'm too ashamed to face them.

448
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,450
Chu Chu.

449
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:02,730
My teacher, Xue Rucheng,

450
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,980
he is the person...

451
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,260
who hired killers in Chang'an to kill officials.

452
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,860
He killed Yan Ming

453
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,720
and started the rumors about Duke Chang.

454
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:21,080
He made counterfeit money in Qianzhou.

455
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,990
He kept soldiers in private

456
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:28,140
and hoarded soldiers, horses, food, and weapons.

457
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:33,230
He is the head of the rebellious party that attempted to seize the base.

458
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,290
What about me?

459
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:45,280
I investigated from Chang'an to Qianzhou,

460
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:50,230
then from Qianzhou to Chang'an.

461
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:55,050
I investigated and investigated.

462
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,710
It turns out this person...

463
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:02,000
has been right in front of me.

464
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,840
I'm like a blind man.

465
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:13,989
It's not your fault.

466
00:32:13,989 --> 00:32:15,790
How is it not my fault?

467
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,930
He went to Qianzhou to clear the obstacles for his great cause.

468
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:23,919
But I told him everything about the counterfeit money case!

469
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,470
I even gave Xu Rugui to him in person!

470
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,109
I gave him a bargaining chip to collude with Qin Luan!

471
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:35,510
How can there be such a stupid judge?

472
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:39,910
How can such a stupid person run the Three Judicial Office?

473
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,840
It's not true.

474
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,500
Your Highness, you are just a judge of Tang.

475
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,360
You are not a god.

476
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,560
How can you know everything without any clue?

477
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,349
Who else could put these

478
00:32:59,349 --> 00:33:03,190
irrelevant cases together?

479
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:06,260
If it weren't for you to risk your life to investigate it,

480
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,389
General Leng's army would have been taken down by them.

481
00:33:09,389 --> 00:33:13,759
You prevented a disaster for the people in the Southwest of Tang.

482
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:16,260
They have escaped now.

483
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,379
But we still have a chance to catch them back.

484
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:21,380
We still can stop his conspiracy in Chang'an.

485
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,590
You are the best judge in Tang.

486
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:33,540
I'm not as good as you said.

487
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,440
I've been sick and weak since I was a kid.

488
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,970
I always strive for the best

489
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:44,110
and push myself to the extreme.

490
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,829
He is the one who taught me

491
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:48,730
to act according to my ability and that is the long-term solution.

492
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:53,030
I kept it from my mother when I started to learn the law.

493
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,740
She only wants me to live a peaceful life.

494
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,729
If it weren't for him to persuade my mother,

495
00:33:57,729 --> 00:34:00,440
I couldn't become a judge at all.

496
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,790
After I went to the court,

497
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,890
I didn't understand the so-called way of the world.

498
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,799
Sometimes I provoked discontent from the officials

499
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,700
and enraged the emperor.

500
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:13,510
He always took the blame for me

501
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,470
and helped me out.

502
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,330
I can't figure it out.

503
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:22,049
If he has been planning this from the beginning,

504
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,840
why would he teach me

505
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,670
and protect me over these years?

506
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:38,470
I've suspected countless people to be the leader of the rebellious party.

507
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:43,100
I suspected almost everyone but not him.

508
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:49,140
He keeps helping you

509
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:52,199
perhaps because he knows you would still become who you are now

510
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,770
without his help.

511
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,640
He is your teacher.

512
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,290
You should respect him.

513
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,700
But he failed your respect.

514
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:09,000
He is the one who failed you.

515
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:13,970
♫ Let time pass by ♫

516
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:19,770
He used to protect you.

517
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:22,820
But you ended up like this.

518
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,930
From now on, I'll protect you.

519
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:28,829
♫ I'll still hold your hands ♫

520
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:36,060
♫ The pattern of destiny is engraved on the palm of your hand ♫

521
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:44,080
♫ If you walk into the rest of my life ♫

522
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,259
♫ Stay with each other gently ♫

523
00:35:46,259 --> 00:35:50,280
Your Highness, you are always the fairest person.

524
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,800
Can you also be fair to yourself?

525
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,870
He is the one who did bad things.

526
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,830
He should be the one to be punished.

527
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:02,429
But why would you lock yourself up and blame yourself?

528
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:04,940
This will only make him more pleased.

529
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,320
You are right.

530
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,300
I should bring him to justice

531
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,390
and let him be punished...

532
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,710
instead of blaming myself

533
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:31,750
and making those who care about me worry.

534
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,160
This is the last time I will call him "teacher."

535
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,320
From now on,

536
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,900
I'm a judge and he is a rebel.

537
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,230
No matter where he hides,

538
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,220
I will arrest him.

539
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,370
No matter what you do,

540
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,600
and no matter how difficult it is,

541
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,560
I'll be there for you.

542
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,360
Remember, you are not allowed to lock yourself up again.

543
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,550
♫ We're by each other's side ♫

544
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,860
I've remembered it.

♫  Nothing can stop me  ♫

547
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:04,629
♫  From missing you all the time  ♫

548
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:11,819
♫  The moonlight appears, cold in the late night,
as the world changes  ♫

549
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:18,180
♫  Only with you by my side can I embrace my yearning for you  ♫

550
00:38:18,909 --> 00:38:25,950
♫  When I close my eyes I meet you once again  ♫

551
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:32,870
♫  I'll gently brush your hair by your ear  ♫

552
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:40,019
♫  Life is long, with love and regrets in this world  ♫

553
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:47,139
♫  With you by my side, no matter how far I go,
we'll never be apart  ♫

554
00:38:47,139 --> 00:38:54,089
♫  With your smile, in this moment, let me
cherish this lifetime  ♫

555
00:38:54,090 --> 00:39:01,059
♫  Only for you, I have to worry about the end of this life  ♫

556
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:08,669
♫  I’m still young, with my love not yet realized for you, but I'm
willing to be here for you till the end

557
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:15,639
♫  You can rely on me in this lifetime  ♫

558
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:24,230
♫  Hope to spend this beautiful lifetime together  ♫
