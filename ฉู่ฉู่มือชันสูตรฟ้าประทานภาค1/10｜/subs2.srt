Why did you come to the southwest with so few men?

19

- This is very dangerous.
- Many thanks, Eldest Brother.

Luckily, the wound isn't very deep.

The bones and muscles are not hurt.

It has nothing to do with luck. It's my prowess.

To be a true master,

59
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,510

His Highness said your grandfather is the Military Commissioner of Qianzhongdao.

How are you? Is it serious?

72
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,490
It's fine. Just a scratch.

73

Is it a scratch? You bled a lot.

74
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,670
No, I'll write to my father

75
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,199

No! Are you ill?

You're the one who's not well right now.

78
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,780
Let's say you write a letter to your father, it has to go all the way to Chang'an.

79
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,270
Then physicians have to come from Chang'an.

80
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,820

00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:19,250
Yes, Master.

180
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,750
Master.

181
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,959
General Wu from Three Chief Judicial Ministries is come by.

182
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,630
He asked me to give you this.

183
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,130
[Qian]

184
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,210
Just one copper coin?

185
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,860
What does he mean by this?

186
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,800
[Kaiyuan Coin]

187
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,470
- Where is he?
- He gave me this letter and left.

188
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,620
He only asked me to give you this.

189
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,840
[Qian]

190
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,639
Go get the carriage ready.

191
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,420
Yes, Master.

192
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,379
This is an open area. Let's rest here.

193
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:28,020
Sure.

194
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,180
Miss Leng, are you all right?

195
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,750
I... I'm fine.

196
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,910
Why don't you lie on my lap?

197
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,770
You can feel better.

198
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,999
Thanks. I'm fine.

199
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Really?

200
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,920
You are nagging like Xiao Jinli.

201
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,409
General Xiao? He didn't say anything just now.

202
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:55,590
He won't nag me.

203
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,360
He only nags His Highness.

204
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,810
He will nag him half a day for some trivia.

205
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,820
You'll know it later.

206
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,990
What is that saying?

207
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,400
He's the apple of his eyes.

208
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,400
General Xiao and His Highness

209
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,050
are so intimate.

210
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,839
His Highness is kind to General, too.

211
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:19,280
These two brothers have been different since childhood.

212
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,200
When His Highness was a kid, he was weak and quiet.

213
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,890
But Xiao Jinli was like a monkey, climbing up and down every day.

214
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,439
They were once playing by the lotus pond in the manor.

215
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:32,059
Xiao Jinli climbed on a tree very quickly,

216
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:35,080
but he ended up falling into the pond.

217
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,520
His Highness couldn't swim, but he jumped in to save him instantly.

218
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,110
Luckily, Aunt Banxia heard the sound and got people there in time.

219
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,210
Otherwise, they could've been drowned.

220
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,449
Princess must've punished General Xiao, right?

221
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,569
Punishment was no big deal.

222
00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:52,099
It was early spring back then.

223
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,520
The water was very cold.

224
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,099
His Highness caught a cold in water.

225
00:14:55,099 --> 00:14:57,249
He didn't get better until the summer.

226
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,969
Princess beat Xiao Jinli and got the pond leveled.

227
00:15:00,969 --> 00:15:03,229
Xiao Jinli has behaved better since then.

228
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,270
I wonder if he's terrified or he felt guilty.

229
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:10,169
Ever since then, Xiao Jinli has been closely watching over him.

230
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,450
So, do not mess with Xiao Jinli.

231
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,340
I'll keep it in mind.

232
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,300
Leng Yue. How are you?  How about I carry you?

233
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,420
I'm fine.

234
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,590
We've arrived. Can you move? Let me help you.

235
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,110
I can walk. Get off.

236
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,990
I'm fine. I can do it.

237
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:57,080
"Fail to repair the room, for no worker can be found."
[Marquis Zhang]

238
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,710
Bravo. Bravo.

239
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,379
Wang Xizhi's "Clearing After Snowfall".

240
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:08,799
The penmanship is stable and tidy, with round and sharp fonts.

241
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:13,610
It's easy to imitate the fonts, but not the conception.

242
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,129
It says, "Fail to repair the room".

243
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:19,490
It's upset to fail to do it.

244
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:25,780
But from the strokes, the writer is obviously in a peaceful state.

245
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,099
You imitated not only the form but also the conception.

246
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,640
You are really great.

247
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,750
These days, you must've put lots of efforts on it.

248
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,220
It didn't take much time.

249
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,110
But the paper and pen did take lots of money.

250
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,770
You're flattering me, Mentor.

251
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,750
I have a strange thing as well.

252
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,510
You may take a look at it.

253
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,369
I'm much flattered.

254
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,539
In terms of paintings and calligraphy, I know a thing or two.

255
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:00,810
But about antiques, I dare not show off in front of you.

256
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,020
[Kaiyuan Coin]

257
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,860
You are injured.

258
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,560
Why are you still here? Go back and sit.

259
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,910
Stop it. Go back and sit.

260
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,620
You're skilled.

261
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:57,570
"Carefully cut as thin as cicada's wings.

262
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,990
Pile up like yarn. Separate like snow.

263
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:04,560
Fly with the wind. The edge keeps moving".

264
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,659
What? What flying snow? It's not snowing.

265
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,449
It was a prince's comment on fillets 600 years ago.

266
00:18:18,449 --> 00:18:21,370
It means, "very good".

267
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,920
Really?

268
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,880
Enjoy yourselves then.

269
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,200
Jinyu, what are you trying to say?

270
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:37,320
Of these 23 copper coins printed with "Qian",

271
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,879
18 coins are fake.

272
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,680
What?

273
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,560
Fake?

274
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,160
I can't tell.

275
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,030
Fake?

276
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,110
How come it looks genuine?

277
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,680
Let me see.

278
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,489
Counterfeiting coins is a death penalty.

279
00:18:57,489 --> 00:18:59,259
Who would do this business?

280
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:01,149
Counterfeiting coins is huge.

281
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:03,950
If they're not powerful enough, they can't afford to do this.

282
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,809
Qianzhou has been in peace these years.

283
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:08,690
I've never heard of anyone who could do this.

284
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,190
Nor have I during my travel.

285
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,159
Since Jinyu said it's in Qianzhou, it must be in Qianzhou.

286
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,309
Seriously?

287
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,450
Could it be Prefect of Qianzhou?

288
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,210
Chu Chu. You live in Qianzhou.

289
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,469
How is this prefect's reputation with the commoners?

290
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,860
Prefect Li is known as a good official.

291
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,420
Hadn't he allocated funds to Guanling County and built bridges and roads,

292
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,090
we'd still use slings now.

293
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,279
I contacted this prefect several times.

294
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,290
He's kind of cunning,

295
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,710
but there's nothing wrong with him.

296
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,190
Your coins must be your military pay.

297
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,419
Even in the military, there are so many counterfeit coins.

298
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:55,530
It must concern many things.

299
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,259
As Prefect of Qianzhou, Li Zhang must have something to do with it.

300
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:01,400
If I guess it right, this prefect

301
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,670
must be waiting for us in Guanling County.

302
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,939
Don't you believe it? A bet of five gold.

303
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:10,170
Bad habit.

304
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:15,370
Commandery Prince An sent it here but didn't say anything.

305
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,480
He wanted to see our reactions.

306
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,310
For Commandery Prince An, everyone is suspicious.

307
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,500
He even suspected you, his mentor.

308
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:32,150
In that case, you've also figured it out about the coin, right?

309
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:37,979
When I received his coin, I didn't get it either.

310
00:20:37,979 --> 00:20:40,399
Then I got another ten coins printed with "Qian"

311
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:43,000
and made a comparison.

312
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Turned out this coin was illegal.

313
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,130
He's your favorite student.

314
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,569
What do you think of this?

315
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:56,260
What will he do?

316
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:03,540
He sent the coin into the capital and gave us in this way.

317
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:08,490
I suppose he wanted to know our reactions.

318
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:13,169
This sounds like his style.

319
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:17,330
Illegal copper coins appeared in all dynasties.

320
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:22,170
The southwest area is remote, yet it's rich in minerals.

321
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:27,370
Illegal cooper cash casting continues despite repeated prohibitions.

322
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,980
I'm worried that he can't find where illegal coins are made.

323
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,729
It's just that this issue must concern the dignitaries in the court.

324
00:21:38,729 --> 00:21:43,839
Given his righteousness, he could cause trouble unknowingly.

325
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,730
You worry too much.

326
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,049
He's also a dignity, isn't he?

327
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:51,819
If he's aware that he's one of the dignities,

328
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:55,240
why do I bother worrying about this?

329
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,559
I'm not worried about dignitaries.

330
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:04,860
I'm afraid it's related to eunuchs.

331
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,759
Qin Luan lives long in the palace.

332
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:11,759
Qianzhou is thousands of miles away.

333
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,270
He can barely manage this thing.

334
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,810
Mentor, in your opinion,

335
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:22,860
who do you think is casting coins illegally?

336
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:27,520
What? Don't you have any clue?

337
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,309
The other day,

338
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,800
you invited the newly appointed Capital Liaison Representative to your manor.

339
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,559
Wasn't it for the investigation of this case?

340
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,510
No, you misunderstood it.

341
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:47,999
I invited him to my place to learn about something

342
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,710
about the border military and political affairs in the prefectures.

343
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,359
It had nothing to do with this case.

344
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,400
Military and political affairs?

345
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:01,100
His Majesty ordered me to be the Minister of War.

346
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,760
Congratulations to you in advance, Minister Xue.

347
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,109
I'm Li Zhang, Prefect of Qianzhou. My respects, Commandery Prince An.

348
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,579
Commandery Prince An comes to Qianzhou. I'm here to visit you.

349
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:28,830
Please pardon me for any offense.

350
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,770
I lost to His Highness again. Li Zhang is really here.

351
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,312
My respects. I'm Zheng Youde.
[Zheng Youde, Magistrate of Guanling County]

352
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,900
My respects. I'm Zheng Youde.
[Li Zhang, Prefect of Qianzhou]

353
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,030
My respects. I'm Tan Gui.
[Tan Gui, Deputy Magistrate of Guanling County]

354
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,179
There are too many state affairs.

355
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:45,209
Even Prefect Li is disturbed to come.

356
00:23:45,209 --> 00:23:46,369
Not at all.

357
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:49,269
I'm much flattered.

358
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:52,589
All right. I'll do it as His Highness said.

359
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:54,720
Who is this lady?

360
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,419
Military Commissioner of Qianzhongdao,

361
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:02,830
General Leng's granddaughter, Leng Yue.

362
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,799
So, you're Miss Leng.

363
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,000
My respects.

364
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,469
Qianzhou is remote and impoverished.

365
00:24:14,469 --> 00:24:16,100
It's incomparable with Chang'an.

366
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,660
But you're guests from afar.

367
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,779
Now that you come here, we should show our hospitality.

368
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:24,200
Yes. Show our hospitality.

369
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,970
Well...

370
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,149
Rest assured, Commandery Prince An.

371
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:29,329
I've long heard of your integrity.

372
00:24:29,329 --> 00:24:31,480
I dare not do anything out of line.

373
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:37,580
I just want to treat you to dinner at Zheng's place, to receive you.

374
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,780
Everything will be simplified so that we'll all be pleased.

375
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,050
Please give us the honor.

376
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,210
Give us the honor.

377
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,710
In this case...

378
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,309
Since you say so, I cannot refuse it.

379
00:24:55,309 --> 00:24:59,910
And I have something to learn from Prefect Li and Magistrate Zheng.

380
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,179
My pleasure. My pleasure.

381
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:03,059
Deputy Magistrate Tan. Hurry and serve tea.

382
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,890
Commandery Prince An, Please. Miss Leng, please.

383
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,660
Please.

384
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,360
[Guanling County Government]

385
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,520
Here. Try this.

386
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,950
Right.

387
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,229
This is tasty.

388
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,030
Eat up.

389
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,510
Eat.

390
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,210
Isn't she the girl of the Chu's family?

391
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,639
That's right. Didn't she go to Chang'an?

392
00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:30,210
These guys must be rich.

393
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,229
I agree.

394
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,890
How come these people come with Miss Chu?

395
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,629
I wonder what she did in Chang'an.

396
00:25:36,629 --> 00:25:38,349
Women are not allowed in government.

397
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,290
Who knows?

398
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:43,450
Who do you mean by Miss Chu? Who are rich?
[Chu He, Chu Chu's brother]

399
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,000
Chu He, don't you know it?

400
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,750
Your sister is back with a bunch of men.

401
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,700
Come and look.

402
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,269
Dried goods. Herbs. Have a look.

403
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,980
My home is over there, not far from this fair.

404
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,220
Your home is quite remote.

405
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:10,310
Chu Chu. Chu Chu!

406
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,979
- Brother.
- Stop. Who are you?

407
00:26:13,979 --> 00:26:16,220
This is my sister. I'm her brother.

408
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,880
Step back.

409
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,389
He... He's my brother.

410
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:22,119
You've been out for so long, and didn't write a letter to us.

411
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,719
Who are these guys with you?

412
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,820
Come here.

413
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,999
Brother, they're not bad guys.

414
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,399
I'll take the coroner's exam with them.

415
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:31,960
The coroner's exam? Who are these guys?

416
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,299
How come you take the exam in this way?

417
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:36,550
I... It's true I'm taking coroner's exam.

418
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,530
Let's go home.

419
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,300
Are you Chu He?

420
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,490
How come he knows my brother's name?

421
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,270
How did you know it?

422
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,530
Who on earth are you?

423
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,170
We're from Chang'an.

424
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:01,100
You can take her home, but we'll go along with you.

425
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:06,309
When we see your elders at home, I'll tell you who we are.

426
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,520
I don't even know you people. Why should I take you to my house?

427
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,760
Because we came here with her all the way from Chang'an.

428
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,210
We are strangers to you.

429
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,240
I understand you're vigilant.

430
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,780
But we can't trust you, either.

431
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,399
She's my sister. I'm her brother.

432
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,999
Why would I harm her?

433
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:25,810
Brother, they're helping me.

434
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:31,760
Since you mean no harm to her, why can't we send her home?

435
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,910
Fine, all right then. Listen up.

436
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:41,130
My family works for the county government.

437
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,880
If you have any evil intentions,

438
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,830
Magistrate Zheng won't spare you.

439
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,820
- Brother.
- Shut it.

440
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,230
Stop speaking.

441
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,030
Please lead the way.

442
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,030
Brother.

443
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:10,950
Chu He, Miss Chu said your family have been coroners for generations.

444
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:13,069
My family is one and only coroner here.

445
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,410
You can ask around here.

446
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,680
Chu is a household name.

447
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,099
In this case, Zheng Youde, the Magistrate,

448
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:21,549
contacts with your family a lot, right?

449
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,799
Of course.

450
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,399
How is he as an official?

451
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,960
He's a good official, never bullying people, also a good judge.

452
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,660
Why do you ask about this?

453
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,200
I'm new here. I'm just asking.

454
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,930
Ermao. Ermao. Ermao. Come here.

455
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,380
Ermao.

456
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,899
Grandfather. Grandfather.
[Chu Ping Chu's father; Chu's grandfather]

457
00:29:04,899 --> 00:29:07,069
- Chu Chu.
- I'm back.

458
00:29:07,069 --> 00:29:08,369
Chu Chu is back.

459
00:29:08,369 --> 00:29:10,130
Grandfather. Father!

460
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,889
- Chu Chu is back.
- Chu Chu is back.

461
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,490
Father.

462
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,729
Are you back now?

463
00:29:14,729 --> 00:29:15,899
You're good, huh?

464
00:29:15,899 --> 00:29:18,539
You left for so long, yet you didn't send a message to home.

465
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:19,759
Come here. I'll break your legs...

466
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,339
Sorry, Grandpa. I'm wrong.

467
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:23,100
Father. She's back safe and sound. Don't be angry.

468
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,170
- Don't defend her.
- Sorry.

469
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,689
If she doesn't learn a lesson, she'll do it again.

470
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:29,109
I meant to write to you.

471
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:32,429
But I wanted to pass the exam and then wrote the good news to you.

472
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,489
Are you arguing with me? You lass!

473
00:29:34,489 --> 00:29:36,260
What if you were cheated?

474
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,630
What if you got harmed?

475
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,780
No one harmed me.

476
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,400
People in Chang'an are very nice. No one bullied me.

477
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,329
I've served as a coroner and filled out autopsy forms.

478
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:46,759
It's just that...

479
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:47,799
I haven't passed the exam yet.

480
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,019
Are you lying now?

481
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:51,309
Who asked you to be a coroner?

482
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,049
Who asked you to fill out autopsy forms?

483
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:55,160
I am not lying.

484
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,640
Calm down, Elder. She isn't lying.

485
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,490
I asked her to be the coroner and filled out autopsy forms.

486
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,740
Did you ask her to be a coroner?

487
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,300
Then... Who are you?

488
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,369
I'm an official from Chang'an in charge of prison affairs.

489
00:30:12,369 --> 00:30:14,470
This is my elder brother,

490
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,400
a general under Military Commissioner of Qianzhongdao.

491
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,599
Chu Chu worked for me while she was in Chang'an.

492
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:26,030
She's meticulous and highly skilled, one of a kind.

493
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:30,809
She told me your family has been coroners for generations, with a long origin.

494
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:32,689
I went to the southwest for work,

495
00:30:32,689 --> 00:30:35,100
passing by your place and paying a visit.

496
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,939
Look. Now do you believe it?

497
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,210
I've worked as a coroner.

498
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,300
Father. An official in charge of prison in the court?

499
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,080
I don't buy it. There's no big criminal case here.

500
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,390
What does an official from the court come for?

501
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:52,030
Moreover, officials from the court must come for big issues.

502
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,759
There should be a convoy at least for a prefect.

503
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:58,270
We're men of the world.

504
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,529
Don't try to fool us like this.

505
00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:02,809
Lass. Be honest.

506
00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:06,270
Did you ask them to make up a lie for you?

507
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,309
Watch your tongue.

508
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,369
Brother, I told you the truth.

509
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,380
So did he.

510
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:15,700
By the way, he has the official credential.

511
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,759
Since you don't believe my words,

512
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:19,329
even though I show you the credential,

513
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:22,100
you'll still doubt if it's true.

514
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:27,760
To prove my identity to a coroner, these things are not necessary.

515
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,529
You said your family is the only coroner in this county.

516
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:33,210
That means,

517
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:36,209
all the murder cases handled by the county government

518
00:31:36,209 --> 00:31:40,499
are examined by your family. Is it right?

519
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:43,470
Yes. Then what?

520
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,849
On October 19th, last year, a debtor in this county

521
00:31:46,849 --> 00:31:50,370
had Gelsemium elegans and killed himself to frame the creditor.

522
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,309
Zheng Youde originally thought the creditor was the murderer.

523
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:57,329
But the report was rejected by the court for an investigation soon after it's submitted.

524
00:31:57,329 --> 00:31:59,530
In the report, it's marked that

525
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:03,170
the testimonies of the debtor's wife were contradictory.

526
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:08,580
Zheng Youde retried the debtor's wife and the truth was revealed.

527
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,140
How did you know it?

528
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,489
I also know another vendetta case on the 5th day of the 7th lunar month, the year before last.

529
00:32:15,489 --> 00:32:18,260
The murderer robbed and killed, disguised as a bandit.

530
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,809
Zheng Youde reported it to the court as a bandit crime.

531
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:22,600
It's rejected as well.

532
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:27,259
The report was replied that the murderer was a local woman in her twenties.

533
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:30,879
Zheng Youde re-investigated several young women in their twenties.

534
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,310
The culprit was finally arrested.

535
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,039
I examined this case. I know it.

536
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,199
That's true.

537
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:41,159
How did you know the reply from the court

538
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,400
that Magistrate Zheng received?

539
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,710
Because I wrote these replies.

540
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,370
We come here for work.

541
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,630
To make it convenient, we're dressed as businessmen.

542
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,349
It's crowded in the street.

543
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,579
I couldn't tell you the truth. Please pardon me.

544
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:02,550
Do you believe it now?

545
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,299
I'm too ignorant.

546
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,569
Sorry for my discourtesy. Please forgive me.

547
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,759
I came uninvited. Skip the formalities.

548
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,210
Sirs, please go upstairs.

549
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,080
Girl, come with me.

550
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,430
But...

551
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,560
Come in, please.

552
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,660
Please.

553
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,379
We're a humble family. It's incomparable to Chang'an.

554
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:37,200
Please make do for a rest.

555
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,750
Please have a seat.

556
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,460
Please.

557
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,710
Thanks.

558
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,020
Please.

559
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,240
- After you, sir.
- Sit, please.

560
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:56,600
Sir. Chu Chu is a girl.

561
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,610
- Did she really work as a coroner in Chang'an?
- Yes.

562
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:02,629
She'd never been to the government before

563
00:34:02,629 --> 00:34:04,710
and knows little about the rules.

564
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,790
Did she make any mistakes?

565
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,310
No.

566
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,380
Lass. Listen to me.

567
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,419
Why do these high-ranking officials come to our family?

568
00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:20,079
Did you make any mistakes?

569
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,629
Listen. I won't allow anyone to bully you.

570
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,599
No.

571
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,230
I don't know either.

572
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:34,079
I want to work for him. He's still testing me.

573
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:40,050
He said if he would hire me, he'd verify my identity of the test.

574
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:44,000
They want to know Chu Chu's background.

575
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,610
He's already sent me home.

576
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:50,220
I guess he won't hire me.

577
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:53,310
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

578
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,020
Nothing.

579
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:59,980
Brother, I missed you so much when I was outside.

580
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,670
Silly girl.

581
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,960
Don't do this again. Understand?

582
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:11,250
Since she didn't make any mistakes, why do you send her home?

583
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,700
To be honest, I didn't mean to send her back.

584
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,329
I just passed by and encountered Chu He.

585
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:19,989
I was afraid she couldn't explain it and get punished

586
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:22,330
if she came back alone.

587
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:26,970
On the other hand, I'd like to come and learn about something.

588
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,060
Is it about Chu Chu?

589
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,999
I heard that a witch doctor lived in Pingle Town.

590
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,380
Does he still live here now?

591
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,750
You... Were you talking about a witch doctor?

592
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,180
The man who used to tell you stories, living behind our house.

593
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,480
What... What happened to him?

594
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,920
He moved away long ago, about four or five years.

595
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,059
Yes.

596
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:05,849
Back then, his legs were hurt. He couldn't walk.

597
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:09,139
The villagers around here thought he couldn't even cure his own legs.

598
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:11,130
They didn't trust him.

599
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:15,770
Besides, he's reluctant to do superstitious things.

600
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:21,260
He led a hard life like a beggar.

601
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,179
It's good that he didn't loathe our family.

602
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:29,000
I used to ask Chu Chu to give him some food and necessaries.

603
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,670
Her father often helped him with some work, like picking herbs.

604
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,489
Chu Chu was very close to him.

605
00:36:35,489 --> 00:36:39,740
She's very sad when he just left.

606
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,220
No one has ever seen him again?

607
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,049
No.

608
00:36:46,049 --> 00:36:49,160
Military Commissioner sent troops to suppress bandits here before.

609
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,010
Was he living here at that time?

610
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,380
Yes. Yes.

611
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,149
I remember I went to tell him that

612
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,850
the troops were suppressing bandits,

613
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,349
and told him to lock the door and stay at home lest he got hurt.

614
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,620
Didn't he say anything about the troops?

615
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,250
No.

616
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:09,680
Oh, right. When I left, he asked me to lock the door.

617
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,920
Sir, I have a favor to ask.

618
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,529
You're our honored guests.

619
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,749
Just be frank. It's my pleasure.

620
00:37:23,749 --> 00:37:25,310
It's getting late now.

621
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:30,520
Would you please allow us to stay the night at your place?

622
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,970
Will he be staying with my family?

623
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:46,980
