Jing Yi pretended to be a wounded soldier and entered the infirmary.

3
00:00:13,649 --> 00:00:15,610
With his secret inquiry and our public investigation,

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,460
we will find out the truth.

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,270
I don't believe these people committed suicide because they were

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,920
possessed by evil spirits.
[Strangulation marks] [Broken hyoid bone]

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,029
Nonsense!

8
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:27,859
I think he is probably behind the whole thing.

9
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,329
What is he up to

10
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:32,690
to get Commandery Prince An here?

11
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,790
Does he want to kill him?

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,099
Although he is in charge of buying supplies,

13
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:40,639
he has no power to deploy troops.

14
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:43,379
He reports these things to General Leng.

15
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,279
General Leng will use his discretion and assign the task to the next person.

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,900
He can't decide who will be sent out.

17
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,179
What about the other thing?

18
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,699
I've asked about it.

19
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,189
While I was away, some soldiers left the base.

20
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,229
Did they go back home?

21
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,830
They are deserters.

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,979
In fact, those people are not really soldiers.

23
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,840
They were bandits incorporated into the army.

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,809
When we send troops to suppress the bandits,

25
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:18,109
normally we won't kill them unless they commit any felony

26
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,909
or resist desperately.

27
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,880
As long as they surrender, they will be incorporated into the army

28
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,729
and be trained to replenish troops.

29
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:27,330
Most of the bandits know some skills to fight.

30
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,360
It's much easier to train them than to train those farmers.

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,490
Those who escaped were taken in this way.

32
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,929
Do you still remember their looks?

33
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,429
I don't have much impression of them.

34
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,970
Hou Bin led the troops during the battle when they were taken in.

35
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,930
After they were captured, they were trained by Hou Bin.

36
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,260
How long had they been trained in the base before they escaped?

37
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,429
- Less than four months.
- Less than four months?

38
00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:59,079
They were only trained for less than four months and they just escaped?

39
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,619
Yes.

40
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,680
The first six months is the easiest time for them to escape.

41
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,050
After all, being a soldier is not as unrestrained as being a bandit.

42
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,270
Well, is there any problem?

00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,580
Why are you here?

47
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,889
Did you get hurt? Kid.

48
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:26,039
I won't be disabled. And I won't bother you anyway.

49
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,559
You... You... You... You kid...

50
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:32,299
How can you talk to your grandpa in this way?

51
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,810
Can you grow up?

52
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,459
Your Highness, Miss Leng presents herself.

53
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:45,629
- Let her in.
- Yes.

54
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,250
Your Highness.

55
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,470
I found something in that man's barracks.

56
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,939
You went to General Leng's barracks?

57
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,940
How did you get in?

[Has the chivalry of the Leng clan...]

[Jing Mansion]

61
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,239
Master, our man monitoring Princess Xiping's Mansion came back and reported

62
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:28,600
that Banxia stopped Zhou Han's carriage at the gate.

63
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,820
It looked like she was looking for someone but didn't find them.

64
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,299
What's the news in the palace?

65
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,019
Our men reported earlier that they have found out

66
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,570
who are looking for the former servants of Princess Xiping's mansion.

67
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,019
Qin Luan made the order.

68
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,669
They not only investigated the former servants of Princess Xiping's mansion,

69
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:56,049
but also nosed into the rumors after Princess Xiping gave birth to twins.

70
00:04:56,049 --> 00:04:57,749
Rumors?

71
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,040
Why would Qin Luan look into these things?

72
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,299
Keep a close eye on Qin Luan these days.

73
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,859
Let me know if you have any news.

74
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,860
Yes, Master.

75
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,709
The good news that you will be promoted to

76
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,429
the general director in charge of palace affairs has spread far and wide.

77
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,840
Everyone is sending their congratulations.

78
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,309
Take a look. There are too many gifts to be counted.

79
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:44,920
These people respect you a lot.

80
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,850
Look at this.

81
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,750
This is from the antique store.

82
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,019
The antique store also sent a gift?

83
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,529
You went to their place in person a few days ago.

84
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,439
They must think you are their protector now.

85
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,600
Then they nerved themselves to send you a gift.

86
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,199
It must be a big gift.

87
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,350

96

I don't understand.

101
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:07,540
What Rukui?

102
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,850
It's Rugui.

Don't you see two words are missing?
[Waiting for...]

104
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,269

105
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:22,420
that they have Xu Rugui.

106
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:27,980
If I want Xu Rugui, I need to see him soon.

107
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,999
Xu Rugui is in the antique store?

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,749
- Doesn't that mean they...?
- A bronze Ruyi.

109
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,720
What an implication.

110
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:46,580
It's time to meet these little brats.

111
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,129
What's the situation in the infirmary?

112
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,999
Those wounded soldiers are just pawns.

113
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,439
They have guessed more than what they really know.

114
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,370
Fortunately, when I played beetles rolling balls with them,

115
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,809
I got some news.

116
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,219
The first person who went crazy in the army is a wounded soldier in the infirmary.

117
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,850
Wounded soldier...

118
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,409
How is that wounded soldier doing now?

119
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,389
He is basically recovered now. I also sounded him out.

120
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:38,239
He really doesn't remember anything.

121
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,870
He insisted that he met something evil.

122
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,549
Is there anything else?

123
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,510
The rumors about evil spirits have spread out from the infirmary.

124
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,980
These wounded soldiers have nothing to do.

125
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:57,050
This bunch of dudes is really garrulous.

126
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,309
After you go back this time, remember to inquire about another person.

127
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,249
Who?

128
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,050
Wu Chen.

129
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,189
Wu Chen? The officer in charge of military supplies?

130
00:09:10,189 --> 00:09:11,590
Yes.

131
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,659
Why do you want to investigate him?

132
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,120
Your Highness, there is an urgent letter from Chang'an.

133
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,710
[Qin Luan caught two maids dismissed from Princess Xiping's mansion long ago]

134
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,510
What's wrong? Is there any trouble in Chang'an?

135
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,879
There must be some trouble.

136
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,700
But I don't know what kind of trouble it is.

137
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,490
What do you mean?

138
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,730
Qin Luan somehow caught two maids dismissed from

139
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:40,709
Princess Xiping's mansion in the early years.

140
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,349
Wu Jiang worried something bad would happen in Princess Xiping's mansion,

141
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,139
so he observed for a few days

142
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,319
and found out Senior Jing is secretly investigating

143
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,489
the things happening during Princess Xiping's pregnancy.

144
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,779
During Princess Xiping's pregnancy?

145
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,980
Why would he investigate that?

146
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,980
Chu Chu, have you found anything special

147
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,289
after the autopsies of these three bodies?

148
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:16,969
I don't know if it's special.

149
00:10:16,969 --> 00:10:20,749
After the autopsies, I found out the drowned breathed in more water

150
00:10:20,749 --> 00:10:23,049
and the burned dead inhaled in more ash

151
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,979
than an average dead person would,

152
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,660
but not as much as a living person.

153
00:10:28,619 --> 00:10:34,489
You mean... They were neither dead nor alive before they died.

154
00:10:34,489 --> 00:10:37,050
Yes. That's what I want to say.

155
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,809
Neither dead nor alive...

156
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:47,900
I think they can be called living corpses.

157
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,830
A living corpse like me?

158
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,630
No.

159
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,079
Let me put it in this way.

160
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,929
If a person is thrown into the water or fire after he is dead,

161
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:07,219
he isn't breathing and he can't inhale in anything.

162
00:11:07,219 --> 00:11:09,439
But a living person is different. He needs to breathe.

163
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,519
He struggles when he tries to breathe,

164
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,399
which will make him breathe in more.

165
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,389
But these two people are different.

166
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:19,759
Although they breathed in things before they died,

167
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,539
the amount they breathed in is much less than a normal person.

168
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:26,849
If you want me to describe what kind of state they were in,

169
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:32,270
they should be breathing normally until they died.

170
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:38,350
Is there anything suspicious about the man who strangled himself?

171
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,150
Feng Li is the strangest one.

172
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,299
Generally speaking, it's hard to strangle yourself,

173
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:44,850
especially in the way he did.

174
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,979
He wrapped a belt around his neck and his hands took

175
00:11:48,979 --> 00:11:50,469
each of the ends.

176
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:52,739
It's even harder to strangle himself in this way.

177
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:54,859
Because once a person is strangled to a certain degree,

178
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,909
he won't be able to breathe because of the pain.

179
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,159
Then he won't have that much strength.

180
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:01,499
He can only strangle himself to death

181
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,739
if he pulls it really hard at first.

182
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,409
But that's not Feng Li's situation.

183
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,859
From the strangulation marks on his neck and palm,

184
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,829
and the fragmentation of his throat,

185
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,019
he didn't strangle himself to death at once.

186
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:20,459
He used the same strength until he strangled himself to death.

187
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,740
You are saying these three people

188
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,160
were in a state of extreme pain without knowing it?

189
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,690
Yeah, exactly.

190
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,579
What did they eat before they died?

191
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,579
Just normal meals. Nothing special.

192
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,089
Your Highness, I don't believe there is any evil spirit in this world.

193
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:49,000
But I've never seen or heard anyone who died like the way they did.

194
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,760
Were they really possessed by some evil spirits?

195
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,559
Well? Are you scared?

196
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,509
Who is scared? I'm not scared.

197
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,869
Even if they were possessed,

198
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,279
you can handle the living part, I'll handle the dead part.

199
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,299
As for those who are neither dead nor alive, we will handle it together.

200
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,590
I don't believe there is anything in the world that we can't handle.

201
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,609
If you are scared, you can sleep at my place tonight.

202
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,870
I think I'm going to read the statements sent by Hou Bin till dawn.

203
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,119
Rest assured to sleep at my place. I won't bother you.

204
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,910
I'll read them with you.

205
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,189
Your Highness, something happened to Vice Minister Jing.

206
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,790
What?

207
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,639
- Take me to him now.
- Yes.

208
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,750
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

209
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,440
Go!

210
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,750
I'll kill you!

211
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,829
I'll kill you! Kill!

212
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,889
Put the sword down. I'll kill you!

213
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:14,930
What's happening here?

214
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,219
Go away!

215
00:14:18,219 --> 00:14:20,020
Are you crazy?

216
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,950
What happened?

217
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,660
What's the situation?

218
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,200
General, this Qianzhou's soldier also went crazy.

219
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,419
He is just like the previous mad soldiers.

220
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,590
His pulse is fine.

221
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,160
Good.

222
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,139
Leng Yue, do you have any method to wake him up as soon as possible?

223
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:57,649
Yes, acupuncture will do.

224
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,420
Take him to my place.

225
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,340
I have something to ask him.

226
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,059
Someone, take him away!

227
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,860
Come on.

228
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,960
Come on.

229
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,420
If you don't mind, can I go with you?

230
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,980
General Leng, please.

231
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,480
Please.

232
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,289
Why are you still standing here?

233
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,969
It's not the first time you saw something like this.

234
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,190
We got Commandery Prince An here.

235
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,750
He will find out the truth soon.

236
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,909
Act like brave men!

237
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,429
If other people know it, they will mock us for

238
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:51,220
being afraid of a little mad soldier of Qianzhou.

239
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,440
Well...

240
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,869
Did you not hear it?

241
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,289
Go back to your place!

242
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,300
Just leave!

243
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,930
- Yes.
- Yes.

244
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,150
Doctor Qi, clean this up.

245
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,679
What's more, hurry up and make a list for me.

246
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,750
Yes.

247
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,260
If you need any drugs, I will order them to buy them.

248
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,289
Yes.

249
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,370
- I'll go to work.
- Okay. Take care.

250
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,450
Master.

251
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,370
[Vice Minister Jing entered the base with Commandery Prince An]

252
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,289
Jing Yi went to Leng Peishan's army with them.

253
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:51,539
It's said that weird things happened in the base of Military Commissioner.

254
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:53,339
There were soldiers and generals

255
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:56,319
committing suicide in public one after another.

256
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,369
Leng Peishan wrote a letter and invited Young Master Jing

257
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,400
and Commandery Prince An there to investigate it.

258
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,179
Looks like Xue Rucheng's trip to the Southwest disturbed Leng Peishan.

259
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:09,739
He took a step ahead.

260
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,140
Well, Young Master Jing and they...

261
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:16,139
Commandery Prince An never acted rashly.

262
00:17:16,139 --> 00:17:20,389
Since he dares to go there with Jing Yi and his people,

263
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:21,860
he must have his own reason.

264
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,290
We need to trust them.

265
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:28,140
Tell our people in the Southwest that if Jing Yi has any order,

266
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,079
they don't need to report it back to Chang'an, just do what he says.

267
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,180
Yes, Master.

268
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,879
I need to think about it carefully.

269
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,310
It won't take long before

270
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:45,720
the court knows Commandery Prince An's visit to Leng Peishan's army.

271
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,460
This is the real trouble.

272
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,070
- It hurts! It hurts!
- Don't move.

273
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,659
Dog, you are finally awake.

274
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:04,960
Dog?

275
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,109
Where am I? Shouldn't I be in the infirmary?

276
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:10,589
This is my room.

277
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,260
Do you still remember what happened just now?

278
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,879
I remember it was dark.

279
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,429
They were sleeping and I was also sleeping.

280
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,379
Then I wake up here.

281
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,169
Do you have any strange feelings about your body?

282
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,120
My body...

283
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,629
The boards on your arms and legs were broken by you.

284
00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:29,309
The wounds must hurt a lot, right?

285
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,080
Of course, it hurts.

286
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,479
It feels like my arms and my legs are broken.

287
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,529
And my neck hurts, too.

288
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,599
What's wrong?

289
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,569
You went crazy just like those soldiers in the army.

290
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,570
Crazy?

291
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,470
Did I go crazy?

292
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,850
I can't remember it at all.

293
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,549
What did I do?

294
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,929
You did nothing.

295
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:58,510
You just almost cut the wooden man in the infirmary into pieces.

296
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,340
Do you not remember it at all?

297
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,790
I, Jing...

298
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,239
I, Dog, swear with my life

299
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,460
that I really don't remember anything.

300
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,839
General Leng, he just woke up.

301
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,289
He is still a little confused.

302
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,119
There are too many people in the infirmary.

303
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,259
I'm afraid it will make him nervous and it won't help him recall the details.

304
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:30,629
It's better to let him calm down a little bit at my place.

305
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,979
I'll let you know if I find out anything later.

306
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,670
Okay. Thank you, Your Highness.

307
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,649
Keep guard at the door.

308
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,939
Don't let anyone come near us.

309
00:19:47,939 --> 00:19:49,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

310
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,819
Jinli, you just saw it.

311
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,099
Those soldiers all went crazy in that way.

312
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,549
It's exactly how weird it is.

313
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:07,180
Yeah. To be frank, we can't blame the soldiers for being scared.

314
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,699
They just somehow went crazy.

315
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:10,600
It's really creepy.

316
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,310
Jinli.

317
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,789
Tell us the truth.

318
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:19,280
Who is that man who went crazy today?

319
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,879
What do you mean?

320
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:23,699
I told you he is a Qianzhou soldier we saved on the way here.

321
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,929
Jinli, we've talked about it for a while.

322
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:31,519
The way that little soldier talked and behaved is nothing like a real soldier.

323
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:33,390
Even the Qianzhou soldiers are slack in their training,

324
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,999
they should at least receive basic training.

325
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:38,659
Yeah. Who is he?

326
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:40,629
Could he be a spy from somewhere?

327
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,629
Stop your wild guess.

328
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,269
He is just a Qianzhou soldier I saved.

329
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,450
He is a raw recruit.

330
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,360
He used to be a poor scholar with some literary skills.

331
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,950
How else could he be bullied by the bandits like that?

332
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,070
What's more, even if he is a spy,

333
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:56,050
will Commandery Prince An not recognize it?

334
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:56,959
That's true.

335
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,569
Of course.

336
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,010
All right. Well,

337
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,229
we are a little incredulous because of what has happened these days.

338
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:05,249
This is just a casual chat between us.

339
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,729
We are definitely not doubting your precious brother's insight.

340
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,230
Yeah.

341
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,230
Hou, how is your injury now?

342
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,650
When did you get hurt again?

343
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,619
Just a flesh wound. It doesn't matter.

344
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:22,709
How does it not matter? Isn't it your flesh?

345
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:24,549
It doesn't matter?

346
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,799
I heard from Wu Chen that your injury hasn't healed yet.

347
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,429
You are even having malignant sores.

348
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,189
You don't even apply the ointment Doctor Qi gave you on time.

349
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,330
Are you trying to show how tough you are or are you just stupid?

350
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,429
All right.

351
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:38,470
I mean you two big men are even more naggy than my wife.

352
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,530
Think about it.

353
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,579
Did anyone approach you on purpose?

354
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,689
Or did you do anything that might have revealed your identity?

355
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:55,760
No.

356
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,789
I got it. The Vice Military Commissioner,

357
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:02,800
General Hou, came to the infirmary before the meal.

358
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,889
He didn't say anything, but he kept looking at me.

359
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,190
I think he is doubting my identity.

360
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,279
What about Wu Chen?

361
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,790
There is nothing strange about Wu Chen.

362
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:16,310
After we stopped gambling, he checked the medicinal materials with the old man Qi.

363
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,149
He didn't take me seriously.

364
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,339
I asked about him.

365
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,679
Usually, he takes care of military supplies.

366
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,360
Sometimes he drafts documents for the army.

367
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,269
He has no power to dispatch the soldiers.

368
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:30,179
The generals and soldiers rarely work with him directly.

369
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,229
They don't have much impression of him.

370
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:36,980
After Hou Bin left, did you eat or drink anything?

371
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,729
Do you think I'm that careless about my life?

372
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:40,460
I was really careful.

373
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,099
I was afraid they would put anything in my food,

374
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,689
I didn't take the medicine at all.

375
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,850
While we were eating, I pretended that I preferred the food of the person next to me

376
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,589
and I changed it.

377
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,119
I had some water before going to bed.

378
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,689
But that was the water of someone else.

379
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,479
I drank it after they all fell asleep.

380
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,759
Your Highness, could it be that their target was someone else?

381
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,420
I was so cautious that I overdid it and got myself poisoned?

382
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,379
According to our previous speculation,

383
00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:07,820
someone led us to the army on purpose.

384
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,590
I think that person wants to kill us in one fell swoop.

385
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,599
But we are in the army now, why would he complicate it

386
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,719
and make a move against someone irrelevant?

387
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,599
We've been here for a while.

388
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,509
We are still alive and kicking.

389
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,109
Except me.

390
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,589
But there is no point in just making a move against me.

391
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,959
You also said I didn't do anything after I went crazy.

392
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,510
I was only cutting wood there.

393
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,270
Did he want to run me down?

394
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,029
Leng Yue, you also saw the symptoms of Jing Yi.

395
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:43,289
Is there any obscure poison or skill

396
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,020
that can make people go crazy like that?

397
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:49,020
Poison... Skill...

398
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,879
They won't feel tired or in pain when they go crazy.

399
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,829
Just like the way Vice Minister Jing was.

400
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,649
Normally, Vice Minster Jing would have cried out loud

401
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,450
if his hands got hurt like this.

402
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:05,119
I don't think you are complimenting me or comforting me.

403
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,620
Don't feel pain.

404
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,350
And can't remember anything afterward.

405
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,280
Apply this to him.

406
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,090
This is...

407
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,330
What's wrong?

408
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,760
I brought this medicine from Chang'an.

409
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,050
It won't be any problem.

410
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:29,170
Jing Yi, did you feel dizzy and thirsty when you woke up?

411
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,590
A little bit.

412
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,799
That's it.

413
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,490
Your Highness, it's datura flower.

414
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,289
Datura flower?

415
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,110
Datura flower is a good remedy for pain.

416
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,109
What's wrong with it?

417
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,409
Datura flower is a good remedy for pain.

418
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,589
But it's really expensive.

419
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,929
There are a few people who can afford it and know how to use it.

420
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,839
Normally the flower is used as medicine,

421
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,459
But every part of the datura flower is poisonous.

422
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,579
The seed is the most poisonous part.

423
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,029
It tastes sweet.

424
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,059
Normally people will have hallucinations after taking a few seeds.

425
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,620
If the toxicity is not serious,

426
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,549
the person will act normally after the hallucination.

427
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:03,190
You can't feel it through the pulse.

428
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,079
I saw it once in Lingnan Mountain.

429
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:07,809
Someone was selling something like Five Minerals Powder

430
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,339
made with datura flower and other medicines.

431
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,179
Hallucinations?

432
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,749
In other words, those who were poisoned went crazy

433
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,789
because they had hallucinations.

434
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,329
Yes.

435
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:24,449
If the hallucination varies from person to person, that can explain

436
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,129
why they went crazy in different ways.

437
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,489
The datura flower is precious and rare.

438
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:32,409
I'm afraid it was provided by Li Zhang.

439
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:35,469
Miss Leng, if people take such poison,

440
00:25:35,469 --> 00:25:38,849
will they show symptoms right away or after a while?

441
00:25:38,849 --> 00:25:40,969
It depends on the usage and the dosage.

442
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:45,260
If they take the seed, they will show symptoms after ten minutes at most.

443
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:50,739
In this case, the poison wasn't in the food.

444
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,759
There wasn't much food left in the stomachs of the three dead soldiers.

445
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,889
They must have finished their meals for a while.

446
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:59,300
It was definitely not just ten minutes.

447
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,570
Then is it water?

448
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,809
Probably not.

449
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:06,889
In the infirmary, the water for the wounded soldiers is heated in a pot.

450
00:26:06,889 --> 00:26:08,389
If the poison was in the water,

451
00:26:08,389 --> 00:26:10,979
those who drank the water should all have gone crazy.

452
00:26:10,979 --> 00:26:13,910
How could you go crazy alone?

453
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:17,390
Then is it the bowl?

454
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,899
We won't know the fact if we keep guessing here.

455
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,279
I'd better go back to the infirmary and keep looking into it.

456
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,529
No way.

457
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,419
Someone wants to kill you and you still want to go back.

458
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,919
Your Highness, I think Jing Yi has gotten the information we need in the infirmary.

459
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,200
It's time to get him back.

460
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,199
Are you worried about me?

461
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:36,510
Yes, I'm worried about you.

462
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,609
All right, don't worry. I've gone crazy once.

463
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:47,669
Wake up wherever you go crazy.

464
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,460
I'm afraid of pain and death.

465
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,909
No matter what hallucinations I have, I won't kill myself.

466
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:57,669
Besides, Your Highness. I think it's not over tonight.

467
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,940
You have to be more careful.

468
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,650
We all need to be more careful.

469
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,479
How dare you sneak into my barracks.

470
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,420
Who do you think you are?

471
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,570
You are way out of my league.

472
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:43,540
You know I moved this?

473
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,840
Of course.

474
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:51,909
If I can't see through your little trick, how could I command

475
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,650
the vast army in Qianzhongdao?

476
00:28:54,650 --> 00:29:01,050
My base would be penetrated by spies.

477
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,300
These letters...

478
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:09,459
Did I put those letters here on purpose for you to find them?

479
00:29:09,459 --> 00:29:14,060
Well, didn't you show these letters to Commandery Prince An?

480
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,890
If Commandery Prince An can't even tell this,

481
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:23,710
then he doesn't have the ability to rule the Three Judicial Offices.

482
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:27,879
- Why?
- Why?

483
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,239
Why not tell you

484
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,509
the reason I couldn't go back when your parents died tragically

485
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,699
in the Ganlu Incident?

486
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,819
That's because if the frontier general

487
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,909
leads the troops into the capital without permission,

488
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:43,549
it will be seen as a rebellion.

489
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:47,940
If I did that, the whole Leng Clan would be executed.

490
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:55,309
At that time, the patriarch put me on a leash

491
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:59,610
and locked me in the dungeon of the ancestral hall.

492
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,529
How could I tell you that?

493
00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:05,449
I wrote letters to your father

494
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,259
on the anniversary of his death every year.

495
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:12,130
And I put the letters in a box like a woman.

496
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:15,809
Well, does it sound glorious?

497
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,850
Will it do any good to you?

498
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,960
Why didn't you tell me

499
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,290
that the doctor said you have...?

500
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,940
Kid, you can't trust a doctor's words.

501
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,149
If you don't trust the doctor, why did you write in the letter

502
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:40,330
that you will reunite with him less than half a year later?

503
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:48,429
I was fooling him.

504
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,430
Let me feel your pulse.

505
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,520
How did you fool the court?

506
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:21,370
General Leng is seriously ill?

507
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:25,069
No way. General Leng looks so strong.

508
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:28,869
I heard that he even had a fight with Miss Leng in the training yard this afternoon.

509
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:34,170
What kind of serious disease does he have?

510
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,900
A bone disease.

511
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,139
Maybe it's an old ailment he got when he fought wars.

512
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:48,950
During these years, he wrote letters to Leng Yue's father

513
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,209
on the anniversary of his death to send condolences.

514
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:54,109
He wrote in the letter that he hid his condition from everyone

515
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,259
because he worries that it will cause a disturbance in the army.

516
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:59,959
He is quietly preparing for his death.

517
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,210
Does Miss Leng know it?

518
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:09,829
She found these letters in General Leng's barracks.

519
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,439
I was going to let her check if there was

520
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,189
any clue about General Leng contacting Li Zhang

521
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:17,379
or about illegal minting of coins.

522
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,739
But she found a box of letters

523
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:22,640
that General Leng wrote to her father over the years.

524
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,499
If General Leng is seriously ill,

525
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,140
he shouldn't be the mastermind behind this.

526
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:35,779
Chu Chu, do you still remember

527
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,349
the two people who tried to kill Xu Rugui?

528
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,709
Yes.

529
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,050
I remember you said after the autopsy that they were both soldiers.

530
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:46,230
Your Highness, why do you mention this?

531
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,729
These people are also soldiers.

532
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:52,349
Jinli found out that before we went into the mountain with Li Zhang,

533
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:55,810
more than 20 soldiers left the base to buy supplies

534
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,739
under Wu Chen's order.

535
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,949
This is exactly the number of soldiers who showed up in the Prefect's Mansion.

536
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:04,339
But Wu Chen doesn't have the power to dispatch troops.

537
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:09,999
Therefore, it must be someone very powerful behind this.

538
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,549
What's more, from the traces of the scene in the wood house that day,

539
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,609
except for the Shence Army who came to kill Xu Rugui,

540
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:18,819
there was another group of people who wanted to capture Xu Rugui alive.

541
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,289
Your Highness, why do you think

542
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,370
it's General Leng who sent people to arrest Xu Rugui?

543
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:40,000
