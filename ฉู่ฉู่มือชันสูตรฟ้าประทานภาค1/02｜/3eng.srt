I think he's the Handsome Judge that I'm looking for.

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,470
But... he looks very curious about my pendant.

11
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,950
Greetings, Your Highness and Vice Minister Jing.

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,099
You may rise.

Thank you, Your Highness.

14

Miss, you must be the coroner Commandery Prince An picked

15
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,330
in today's selection test.

16
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,269
Congratulations.

17
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,550
No. No. The result hasn't come out yet. I just...

18
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,800
General Zhou, did His Majesty send you here for any mission?

19
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,749
Here's the thing.

20
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,339
When I was patrolling in the Palace,
[Three Judicial Chief Ministries]

21
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,909
I picked up a bunch of keys.

22
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,699
I guess some official lost them when he left the Palace.

23
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,510
I'm then asking in all departments.

24
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,980
General Zhou, where did you find the keys?

25
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,750
In the corridor outside Xuanzheng Hall.

26
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,620
Don't bother, then.

27
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,150
Even if you visit all departments in Chang'an,

28
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,339
no one will claim them.

29
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,820
What do you mean, Vice Minister Jing?

30
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,750
In the way you're looking for the owner,

31
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:40,069
soon all officials will know that someone lost a bunch of keys.

32
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,109
It's no problem if they're normal keys.

33
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,910
If they're keys to archives, storerooms, or prison,

34
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,211
the owner will be in big trouble.

35
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:51,430
If I lost the keys, I would never admit that.

36
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,160

Besides Jing Yi,

93
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,020
he also took a female coroner who took part in the exam.

94
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,520
Female coroner?

A girl even wants to be a coroner?

96
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,870
I asked about her.

97

When she first came to the capital, she met Jing Yi privately.

98
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,350
She also took part in the exam, for Jing Yi's sake.

99
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,710
A female coroner?

100
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:29,650
Make an issue of female... Sounds like what the Jing Family do.

101
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:34,770
Not only Jing Yi works for Xiao Jinyu, but also a female coroner.

102
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,419
Jing Zhi thinks so highly of Xiao Jinyu.

103
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:44,230
Jing Yi is smart, but he's a playboy who enjoys wealth and honor.

104
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,550
In case of corpses, he can't help feeling terrified.

105
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,849
It makes sense when Jing Zhi plants a female coroner

106
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,500
to spy on Xiao Jinyu.

107
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,999
I failed to figure out who she is.

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,600
But I find something suspicious.

109
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,769
What is it?

110
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,920
When I saw Xiao Jinyu today, he was holding a stone pendant.

111
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,880
As soon as he saw me, he hid it right away.

112
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,220
When he stared at the pendant,

113
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,350
I felt that he cared a lot about it.

114
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,250
The female coroner said it was her pendant.

115
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,650
Stone pendant?

116
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,230
What does it look like?

117
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,160
It's flat, with carved patterns.

118
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,239
Looks like one of two halves.

119
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,570
- It has...
- Blue Tassel?

120
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,470
Eunuch Qin, you know that?

121
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,669
Did you see it clearly?

122
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,260
I'm sure I did.

123
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,970
Looks like the blue tassel isn't from any ordinary family.

124
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,100
I looked at it a few more times and I was quite impressed.

125
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:51,020
Why does a female coroner have the love token

126
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,630
of Princess Xiping and Xiao Heng?

127
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,279
Don't worry. I'll take her back.

128
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,320
Go. Go ahead.

129
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,160
Is Xiao Heng...?

130
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,820
I must send someone to get some intel from Princess Xiping.

131
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,100
According to the first witness,

132
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,500
when he arrived here, he found the dead man.

133
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,510
Did the witness move anything in this place?

134
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,869
He claimed he didn't.

135
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,870
Come on, Your Highness. What do you mean "claim"?

136
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,989
I didn't!

137
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,210
Lord Jing, you found the dead man?

138
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,469
Yes.

139
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,170
Lord Jing, how did you find him?

140
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,490
I heard the scream.

141
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,470
That night, Yan Ming held a banquet in the foreyard,

142
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,760
to show off his valuable calligraphy.

143
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,069
Unexpectedly, he didn't come back after a long while.

144
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,469
Later, there was a scream coming from the study.

145
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,200
Then came the scream of a dancing girl. I rushed here immediately.

146
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,870
As soon as the dancing girl pushed the door open,

147
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,789
she saw what happened in the study

148
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,570
and slumped on the ground out of fear.

149
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:15,710
Before she recovered from the shock, Jing Yi arrived.

150
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,410
So, he was the first to get into the study and checked on Yan Ming.

151
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:24,229
Didn't the dancing girl or Lord Jing see the murderer?

152
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:28,350
Not to mention the murderer, there wasn't even a suspect.

153
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,250
Look here, there's a big spot of blood.

154
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,299
There must have been blood on the murderer.

155
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,539
I asked to seal the manor for a thorough search immediately.

156
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,189
No one was missing. No extra men were here, either.

157
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,749
But we found no one who had blood on him.

158
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,539
Don't you think it's strange?

159
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,340
The bloodstain looks smooth.

160
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:49,070
I think Yan Ming took the box out and put it here.

161
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,950
When he was dead, the calligraphy wasn't in the box.

162
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,459
So did he... did he take it out and show it to the murderer?

163
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,880
Where's the calligraphy now?

164
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,750
Now that Yan Ming showed it to the murderer and it's missing now,

165
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,650
it means the murderer wanted the calligraphy, killed Yan Ming

166
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,300
and ran away with it?

167
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,170
I don't think the murderer wanted the calligraphy.

168
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,029
How do you know he hid it in this place?

169
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:19,339
When something is hidden among similar things,

170
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,999
people can't easily see it.

171
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:23,700
Now that the murderer didn't want the calligraphy,

172
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,089
the stain on it didn't matter. Why did he hide it?

173
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:27,900
If he hadn't hidden it,

174
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,170
would you think he was a thief who killed Yan Ming

175
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,660
so as to get the calligraphy?

176
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,890
I heard that the calligraphy was missing after Yan Ming was killed.

177
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,870
Did Commandery Prince An find any clue?

178
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,659
He hasn't told me about it.

179
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,069
Yan Ming was killed because of the calligraphy.

180
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,559
It's not appropriate to say this,

181
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:54,439
but what a pity when the calligraphy is missing!

182
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:57,770
In my humble opinion, Yan Ming may not be killed

183
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,040
because of the calligraphy.

184
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,659
Then why was he killed?

185
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,659
If the murderer only wanted to steal the calligraphy,

186
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,580
he didn't have to kill Yan Ming.

187
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,500
It makes sense.

188
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,949
You checked the crime scene.

189
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,309
What else did you see from the corpse?

190
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,459
You can tell me now, can't you?

191
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,309
- I want a try.
- How?

192
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:25,430
- Could you pretend to be the murderer?
- How?

193
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,639
- Just show me how you think the murderer killed Yan Ming.

194
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,610
I'll show you how I think Yan Ming died.

195
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,850
All right.

196
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,299
What's in your hand?

197
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,059
The weapon. It's a meter long and as thick as wheat straw. Anything wrong?

198
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:45,700
Someone's dead!

199
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,389
Help!

200
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,870
What are you doing?

201
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,409
I'm pretending to be Yan Ming.

202
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:54,419
I'm showing you the calligraphy, but you hold a weapon.

203
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:56,180
Of course, I would yell for help!

204
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,259
You're right.

205
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,949
I wasn't thinking in the murderer's position.

206
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,550
Let's try again.

207
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,290
Look at this.

208
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,099
This isn't right.

209
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,440
It doesn't make sense.

210
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,649
There's really a hole.

211
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:42,979
That's how he protected himself from Yan Ming's blood.

212
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,580
In this way, people without the bloodstain are also suspectable.

213
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,409
You said something's not right. What's that?

214
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:53,990
I mean there's no trace of bumping on Yan Ming's back.

215
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,200
He shouldn't have fallen down like this.

216
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,340
But if you take a look at the bloodstain, he did.

217
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,999
Then the murderer held him before he bumped into the desk,

218
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:06,720
like you just did.

219
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,239
The murderer killed him.

220
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:09,900
Would he even worry if he would be wounded?

221
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,439
Then why did you hold me?

222
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,390
You're the murderer.

223
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,100
Miss Chu, if you wanted to be serious,

224
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,129
you didn't scream like Yan Ming did.

225
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:24,229
I don't know what you heard.

226
00:12:24,229 --> 00:12:27,659
But Yan Ming didn't scream before he died.

227
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:28,589
Why?

228
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:29,779
Judged from the blood on the ground,

229
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:31,789
the upper part of his heart was stabbed.

230
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,709
It's the connection part between the heart and the blood vessels.

231
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,109
When it was stabbed immediately, Yan Ming would be out of breath

232
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,369
because of the huge blood loss.

233
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:39,910
He wouldn't be able to scream at all.

234
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:45,950
Jing Yi, are you sure you heard Yan Ming's scream?

235
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,429
The murderer screamed?

236
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:52,289
If so, the murderer would stop Yan Ming from bumping into the desk.

237
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,529
Why?

238
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:56,680
In case he made a noise and others would notice.

239
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,309
Would you like to try again with me?

240
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:00,710
Yes.

241
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:11,900
To fool others, the murderer faked the crime scene.

242
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,869
Someone's dead!

243
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,770
What are you doing?

244
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,619
You're the murderer and Yan Ming, aren't you?

245
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:33,629
There should be a dancing girl. I would pretend to be her.

246
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:35,049
It was what happened that night.

247
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,849
Now that you pretend to be the dancing girl,

248
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,119
don't you realize something wrong with her?

249
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,299
What's wrong with her?

250
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:43,969
It took her a while to find Yan Ming after she came.

251
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,319
There was a short interval between the two screams.

252
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,269
When the murderer screamed,

253
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:50,940
the dancing girl must have been in the yard.

254
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,120
No matter how fast the murderer left, she must have seen him.

255
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,009
But why did she stay and do so much, instead of leaving immediately?

256
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:00,930
That's right.

257
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,319
[Jiangshan Hall]

258
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,749
Your Majesty, I wonder

259
00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:09,390
if I should say something about Yan Ming's case.

260
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,870
Go ahead.

261
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,390
Yan Ming is a vice six-rank official,

262
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,440
but he's at least a minister.

263
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:21,679
His case has been suspended for half a month.

264
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:24,629
After you gave a time limit,

265
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:29,969
Commandery Prince An used Yan Ming's corpse for the Coroner Test,

266
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,329
instead of solving the case quickly.

267
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,969
He's absolutely disrespecting you.

268
00:14:33,969 --> 00:14:35,549
He's so careless and arrogant!

269
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:38,440
No wonder other officials impeach him.

270
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,229
I shouldn't have spoilt him.

271
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,609
If he doesn't find out the murderer before sunset,

272
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,300
I'll dismiss him from the office!

273
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,160
Did you search the dancing girl's body immediately?

274
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,339
I did.

275
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:55,649
But that wasn't very necessary.

276
00:14:55,649 --> 00:14:57,159
She wore such a thin dancing dress.

277
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:00,440
How could she hide a one-meter-long weapon?

278
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,930
So, she left the weapon here.

279
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,460
It's the weapon.

280
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,300
He can even find this?

281
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:25,009
I think the dancing girl learned from some ventriloquists in the Dancing Service.

282
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:26,529
It's hard to imitate a man's voice,

283
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:28,959
but it wasn't very hard to scream only.

284
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,309
She didn't hold the weapon or had the blood on her.

285
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:32,779
She could have left directly.

286
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,720
Why did she scream twice?

287
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,360
According to her confession,

288
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,339
she wanted to steal something in the yard on her way to the latrine.

289
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,859
As checked, she greeted other dancing girls who came with her

290
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,129
before she left.

291
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,389
She also met a maid and asked the way.

292
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:52,829
But she couldn't be vindicated with such simple evidence.

293
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:56,390
She couldn't assure her safety unless she made herself the witness.

294
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:01,580
A girl tricked me?

295
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,479
Wait. What did she steal?

296
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,329
Go catch her in the Dancing Service and ask her.

297
00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:08,509
She must have run away after she stole the thing.

298
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,089
You'd better issue a warrant.

299
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,220
What if she's still there?

300
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,410
Why did Lord Jing leave through the window?

301
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,000
That's his bad habit.

302
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,859
You're awesome, Your Highness.

303
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:36,879
You're even smarter than the Handsome Judge.

304
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,660
Your Highness, may I still work for you?

305
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,969
You must answer all my questions, then.

306
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:44,370
All right.

307
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,990
Tell me about your pendant.

308
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,069
Pendant?

309
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:51,949
Are you... Are you really not the Handsome Judge?

310
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:53,350
I'm not.

311
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,360
What does he have to do with the pendant?

312
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,350
I can't tell you unless you're the Handsome Judge.

313
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,750
Yan Ming's case isn't closed yet.

314
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,479
I need you to give evidence in court.

315
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,599
You can't leave Chang'an before that.

316
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,000
And you must come whenever you're needed.

317
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,840
Your Highness.

318
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,980
Miss Chu, is this yours?

319
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,879
I don't even know where I lost it.

320
00:17:19,879 --> 00:17:21,600
Where did you find it?

321
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,600
You silly girl, you don't even know your package was stolen.

322
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,839
Stolen? Who stole it?

323
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,019
Just now.

324
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,680
The waiter who asked for the bill.

325
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:35,699
But he doesn't look like a thief.

326
00:17:35,699 --> 00:17:40,780
Didn't you realize your package smelled like that waiter?

327
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,819
What smell?

328
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,999
The smell of honey locusts and atractylodes that coroners have.

329
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,359
He's a waiter in an inn.

330
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,290
He doesn't use that.

331
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,769
You keep holding the package in your arms.

332
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,329
It must be very important to you.

333
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:57,759
When you checked in, you wouldn't give it to the waiter.

334
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,230
So, it's very likely that he searched your package secretly.

335
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,710
You really know everything.

336
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,650
Wait.

337
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,490
This isn't my purse.

338
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,140
No. I mean this is my purse.

339
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,529
But the coins are not.

340
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,350
They're yours, too.

341
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,049
It's your pay.

342
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,950
Keep them carefully.

343
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,720
So many coins for such a short time?

344
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,470
Isn't it great to work for you...?

345
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,839
What?

346
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,850
Your Highness, please give these coins back to Lord Jing.

347
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,660
All right.

348
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,850
Send some men to follow her.

349
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,120
Check where she goes

350
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,759
and who she meets.

351
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,830
Yes.

352
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:10,230
Also, exchange her own coins.

353
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,080
Amazing whip, Your Grace!

354
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,199
What are you scared of?

355
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,409
You don't deserve to be killed by my whip.

356
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,110
I don't. I don't!

357
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,770
What are you coming for?

358
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,230
For your information, Your Grace,

359
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,689
these are grapes from the Western Regions.

360
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,150
My master asked me to bring them...

361
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,070
Get out!

362
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,400
Princess, my master truly cares for you.

363
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,970
Get out!

364
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,950
Go, go, go.

365
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,190
Go back and tell Qin Luan.

366
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,690
Don't think I don't know he always complains to His Majesty.

367
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,540
How dared he slander Commandery Prince An!

368
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,719
What does he think he is?

369
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,230
Get out with your grapes!

370
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,390
Yes. Yes, I will.

371
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,190
Get out!

372
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,999
Let's go. Go.

373
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,010
Be quick!

374
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,280
Leave us. What happened?

375
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,569
Didn't I ask you to get some intel from Princess Xiping?

376
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,479
Look what a mess you're in!

377
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,879
I got nothing, Master.

378
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,069
Princess Xiping has such a big temper.

379
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:40,020
Before I finished, she lashed at me!

380
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:44,560
Master, it doesn't matter when I'm aggrieved.

381
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,429
But Master, I work for you.

382
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:50,650
When she lashed my hips, she was exactly slapping your face!

383
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,260
What did you say?

384
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,740
Don't get angry, Master. I don't mean that.

385
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:00,150
You're useless.

386
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,229
Master, you asked me to ask about the female coroner.

387
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:11,810
Do you suspect she has something to do with Prince Consort Xiao Heng?

388
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:15,340
What kind of special connection do they have?

389
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,649
Does she have something to do with Xiao Heng

390
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:29,000
or does someone else want Xiao Jinyu to think so?

391
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,410
Anyway, someone must have seen

392
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:41,360
Xiao Heng and known where he is.

393
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,630
As long as we know who the female coroner is,

394
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:58,670
all problems will be solved.

395
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,360
Master, you care about the pendant.

396
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,930
Does it have a special meaning?

397
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,679
Princess, it takes trouble to blend.
[Princess Xiping Manor]

398
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,240
Have some rest.

399
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,929
When did I ever do such a thing?

400
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:24,910
If my husband comes back someday,

401
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:29,140
he'll laugh at me when he sees me.

402
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,130
Princess.

403
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,540
You all want me to believe that

404
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,410
he's dead.

405
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:42,350
But in his grave, there's nothing but a set of clothes.

406
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,960
I won't believe he's dead

407
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,670
until I see his body.

408
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:50,409
Your Highness, I also wish him to come back.

409
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,529
But it's been so many years.

410
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,480
If he were still alive, why didn't he come to see you,

411
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,680
considering your deep love?

412
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,550
Stop. I don't want to listen.

413
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,300
Don't let my children

414
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,950
know about the cenotaph.
(T/N: cenopath - empty tomb)

415
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,830
Yes ma'am.

416
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,080
Especially Jinyu.

417
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,250
If he knows, he'll look for his father, regardless of anything.

418
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,220
We mustn't tell my children about it.

419
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,940
He's so handsome and so kind.

420
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,380
He solves cases,

421
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,310
and wants to hire a female coroner.

422
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:35,380
- The Handsome Judge is perspicacious and kind.
- Perspicacious and kind.

423
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,699
He has an abhorrence of sin and a handsome appearance

424
00:23:38,699 --> 00:23:41,950
so that people like him at first sight.

425
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,170
Isn't he the Handsome Judge?

426
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,680
Why doesn't he admit that?

427
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,030
[Notice]

428
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,060
How is that possible?

429
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,560
Sir. Sir?

430
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,170
What happened?

431
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,180
Something surprising.

432
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,710
Three Judicial Chief Ministries solved a criminal case

433
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,130
where a man was struck by lightning.

434
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,830
Look, here's a notice,

435
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,989
telling us how to protect ourselves from lightning.

436
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:16,779
Oh my God!

437
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:18,959
People can even die like that?

438
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,020
Yes. I saw that today.

439
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,710
You saw the lightning?

440
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,660
No.

441
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,090
I mean I helped to solve the case today.

442
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,980
I checked the dead man who was struck by lightning.

443
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,450
You're a coroner?

444
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,590
What bad luck!

445
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,919
Sir, are you all right?

446
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,300
Why didn't you watch your steps?

447
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,549
Miss, are you trying to hit me to death?

448
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,339
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

449
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,480
Let me check on you.

450
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,099
Don't touch me.

451
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,370
Sir, I think you're hurt.

452
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,270
Let me take you to see a doctor.

453
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,110
It's kind of you.

454
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,240
Don't bother, Miss.

455
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,330
I have medicine at home.

456
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,860
I live near here.

457
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,950
Let me get you back home, then.

458
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,480
All right. Thank you.

459
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,380
Come on. Stand up.

460
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,680
Be careful.

461
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,050
Your Highness.

462
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,200
Greetings, Your Highness.

463
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,650
She's the dancing girl?

464
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,350
Yes.

465
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,110
She ran quickly.

466
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,370
I've never been so tired before when chasing girls.

467
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,270
Take her away.

468
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,110
You're right again.

469
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,780
She was still practicing dancing in the Dancing Service.

470
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,389
I lose whenever we make a bet.

471
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,990
How boring!

472
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,090
Others give good things to beautiful girls.

473
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:59,350
But everything His Majesty awards me goes to you.

474
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,880
But you're wrong about one thing.

475
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,700
What is it?

476
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:07,280
You said she had stolen something from Yan Ming.

477
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,270
I searched her residence in the Dancing Service,

478
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,691
but didn't find anything.

479
00:26:10,691 --> 00:26:13,360
What exactly did she steal from Yan Ming?

480
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,659
Besides, I personally searched her body that night.

481
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,750
Even her shoes were taken off.

482
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,130
What could she have stolen?

483
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:31,690
[Year of Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, Wu, Ji, Geng, Xin...]

484
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,810
[Year of Renchen]

485
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,200
That's what she stole.

486
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,160
What?

487
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,240
A book volume.

488
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,600
Interrogate her and find it.

489
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,150
She really stole something?

490
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:51,051
All right, then. I won't decline a job to deal with a beautiful girl.

491
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:55,620
After interrogating her, ask the three grave robbers in prison.

492
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,630
According to them, they know very well

493
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,020
about all nearby grave robbers.

494
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,410
Grave robbers?

495
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:04,110
Why do you want to ask about them?

496
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,470
Isn't it Miss Chu's pendant?

497
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,430
I asked Wu Jiang to borrow it from my mother.

498
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:19,260
It's Princess Xiping's pendant? Then...

499
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,989
I haven't seen my father's pendant before.

500
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:26,469
But Chu Chu's pendant has the same pattern and the same tassel.

501
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:30,959
You think someone robbed Prince Consort's grave, got the pendant out,

502
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,839
and gave it to a female coroner so that you would be attracted

503
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,370
and more likely to hire her?

504
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,649
I asked the three grave robbers.

505
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:46,470
They said that no one had robbed my father's grave.

506
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,479
So, she didn't get this pendant from his grave.

507
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,770
Do you think she looks like a spy?

508
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,839
She came from the Southwest.

509
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,039
Prince Consort was also killed by rebels in the Southwest.

510
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,560
He might have lost it somewhere

511
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,180
and someone picked it up before giving it to her.

512
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,980
If this is the truth, why doesn't she admit?

513
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,810
Miss, it's right ahead.

514
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,430
Be careful.

515
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,859
What do you want?

516
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,640
Miss, go with me and I won't kill you.

517
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,740
I... I don't have money.

518
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,351
- I'm... I'm ugly, too. I even eat a lot.
- Shut up!

519
00:28:38,351 --> 00:28:39,969
I work for Commandery Prince An!

520
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,630
Stop nagging and give me the pendant!

521
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,030
Pendant?

522
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,350
Give the pendant to me!

523
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,760
Give it to me!

524
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,500
Go!

525
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,459
Miss Chu, shall we go back to Three Judicial Chief Ministries?

526
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,349
All right.

527
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,950
This way, please.

528
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,229
Master, you're back?

529
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:42,110
Madam said you wouldn't have dinner if you didn't come back.

530
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,500
Has Jing Yi come back?

531
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,300
He can't come back very soon.

532
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:51,330
The Coroner Exam has already concluded.

533
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,579
Where has he gone?

534
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,179
According to his servant, he has gone to the Dancing Service

535
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,950
to catch the murderer who killed Yan Ming.

536
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,359
He found out the murderer?

537
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,820
Yes, he did.

538
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,320
Your Highness.

539
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,960
Your Highness.

540
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,130
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

541
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,630
Your Highness.

542
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,339
What happened? Stop crying.

543
00:30:18,339 --> 00:30:21,380
Explain to me before you cry again.

544
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,530
Or...

545
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,160
Or keep crying for a minute.

546
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,299
Wu Jiang, what happened?

547
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,339
A gang of villains tried to kidnap Miss Chu.

548
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,930
Who are they?

549
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,559
I'm sorry, but I failed to catch anyone alive.

550
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,759
I only bring back a corpse.

551
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,869
Please punish me, Your Highness.

552
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,059
Don't... Don't punish him.

553
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,309
I didn't know they were bad men.

554
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,810
It was all my fault.

555
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,509
And they didn't kill those kidnappers.

556
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,270
A villain did.

557
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:00,900
All right. I won't punish them.

558
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,220
Are you hurt?

559
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,080
Then what are you crying for?

560
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,309
I feel like I had a nightmare.

561
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:11,049
I didn't wake up until I saw you.

562
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,140
Then I couldn't help crying.

563
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,420
What do you mean?

564
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:23,940
Your Highness, you asked General Wu to save me today, didn't you?

565
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,389
You helped me again.

566
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,599
You helped me several times today.

567
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,450
I…

568
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:33,260
Shall I... Let me kowtow to you.

569
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,379
There's no such rule with me.

570
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,749
Don't bother to be so courteous.

571
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,269
You don't be courteous, either.

572
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,439
Stop calling me Miss Chu.

573
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,090
Call me Chu Chu.

574
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,809
All right. Chu Chu.

575
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,459
You took back the corpse?

576
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,509
Yes.

577
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,419
- Go get us a coroner.
- Yes.

578
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:00,799
Don't bother. I'm a coroner.

579
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,819
Your Highness, you saved me.

580
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,939
I don't know how to pay you back.

581
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,330
All I can do is to perform an autopsy.

582
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,579
I can do it on anyone.

583
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,779
Let me do it for you.

584
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,859
I want an autopsy on the kidnapper.

585
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,309
Are you still willing to?

586
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,710
Yes.

587
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,770
His heart was stabbed by something sharp.

588
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,380
The cut is neat.

589
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,260
He died with one stab.

590
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,990
Thick calluses between his right thumb and the index finger.

591
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,680
He's sound in limbs.

592
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,890
Your Highness,

593
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,700
in her purse, there're 23 copper coins with Qian Printing.

594
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,210
I checked in the Minister of Revenue.

595
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,000
Nineteen of the coins are illegal coins.

596
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,260
They're the same as what the merchants from Qianzhou used you saw in the West Market.

597
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,570
You didn't say much, did you?

598
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:10,270
Don't worry. I know what I should say.

599
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:13,890
But I think there's something suspicious with Miss Chu.

600
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,840
She gave this to me today.

601
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,360
It's poisonous?

602
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,210
No.

603
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,140
If she poisoned it, she would be someone

604
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,450
I unintentionally offended during a case

605
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,240
and she simply came to take revenge.

606
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,530
That would be simple.

607
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,210
But this isn't poisonous

608
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,350
and she flatters me all the time.

609
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:37,800
She's more eager to be admitted than ordinary coroners.

610
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:41,190
If someone is behind her,

611
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:45,170
the pendant she holds must be the bait.

612
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,819
But she prefers to give up the chance of getting a job,

613
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,029
rather than tell me how she got the pendant.

614
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:55,790
With all due respect, Your Highness, Jing Yi found that girl.

615
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,960
Get to the point and then leave!

616
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:18,370
Your Highness, there's no restriction for tomorrow's selection exam,

617
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:22,530
is there?

618
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:25,939
I met a genius coroner today!

619
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,829
But she's a bit special

620
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:32,299
and she can't be admitted to Three Judicial Chief Ministries unless you help her.

621
00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:36,269
I promise you, she'll impress you!

622
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:39,370
Then you come to annoy me first?

623
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,970
I'm serious, Your Highness.

624
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:44,110
No way.

625
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:48,550
You know what? If you miss out on her, you'll regret all your life!

626
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:53,829
I mean even if someone helps her, it can't be me.

627
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:57,880
Otherwise, when people know about it, there'll be trouble.

628
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,139
I'll help her, then.

629
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,109
I'll be the invigilator tomorrow.

630
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:03,309
Jing Yi grew up with me.

631
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,390
I know him very well.

632
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,349
He won't do this to me.

633
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,870
He doesn't need to do so, either.

634
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:14,700
Wu Jiang, have you heard about the Handsome Judge she just mentioned?

635
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,380
I haven't.

636
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,379
Now that you want to know about her pendant

637
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:24,139
and obviously, Miss Chu hasn't met the Handsome Judge before,

638
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,720
why don't you pretend to be him?

639
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,520
What if she wants a code

640
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,210
or to check about some birthmark or nevus?

641
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,150
You're right.

642
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,651
Even if I can pretend to be someone,

643
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:39,459
I need to know what this man looks like.

644
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,940
Yes. Yes. You're right, Your Highness.

645
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,979
We can't figure out if there's such a man in the martial world.

646
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,749
Send a letter to Leng Yue.

647
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,490
We should ask her what she knows most.

648
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,520
Yes.

649
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,480
By the way, who kidnapped her?

650
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,069
They're martial art masters.

651
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,509
But they deliberately concealed their martial arts.

652
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,219
I can't tell who they are.

653
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,830
As far as I see,

654
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,509
they came for Miss Chu on purpose.

655
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:08,139
Also, they don't want to kill her.

656
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,370
They don't want to kill her?

657
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:13,270
Yes. I heard them say...

658
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:16,470
Go with me and I won't kill you.
