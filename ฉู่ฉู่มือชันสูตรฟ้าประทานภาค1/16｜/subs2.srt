2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,540
My mother was killed!

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,490
Please redress the grievance for her!

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,420
Who exactly is Lady Xu?

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,340
Xu Rugui kidnapped Chu Chu, but left her mother's hairpin.

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,970
What exactly does he want?

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,519
Who...? Who are you?

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,669
But everything was in a mess that day.

9
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,149
You may not remember my face.

10
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,980
Or perhaps you have remembered

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,640
someone who looked sort of like me in Rugui House.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,390
You... You are...?

13
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,490
I'm Xu Rugui.

14
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:57,460
[The Imperial Coroner]

15
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,260
[Episode 16]

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,729
Why are you here again?

17
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,880
Xu Rugui kidnapped Chu Chu.

18
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,730
- What?
- Tell me. Did you find anything in Lady Xu's belongings?

19
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,290
Why do you care for this now? Go find Chu Chu!

20
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,610
I checked the area where she was taken.

21
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,250
This is what Xu Rugui left there.

22
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,520
It also belongs to Lady Xu.

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,010
What do you mean?

24
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,059
Xu Rugui must know something about Chu Chu's parents.

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,100
He left the hairpin, so I'll check on that.

26
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,600
Tell me. What did you find?

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,540
Or what is it that you know?

28
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,130
You... what do you mean?

29
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,480
Since we left the capital, you've been hiding something from me.

30
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,620
I didn't ask when you didn't want to tell me.

31
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,120
I may turn a blind eye, but do you think I'm really blind!

32
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,119
What are you losing temper at me? What have I done?

33
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,770
I trust you, like I trust the other me in the world!

34
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,770
I believe you won't hurt me,

35
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,390
but you must explain what happened today!

36
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,070
If Chu Chu is dead, I won't let go of you...

37
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,169
or your family!

38
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,070
Are you crazy?

39
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:12,180
Xiao Jinyu, don't you remember what Qin Luan wants?

40
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Xu Rugui wants to kill us and catch Chu Chu alive! Alive!

41
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,030
Don't you know what that means?

42
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,650
It means, for the moment, Chu Chu won't be dead!

43
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,780
But if you keep losing your temper like this, it'll be too late!

44
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,720
Yes.

45
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,999
I stalked you to the Witch Doctor's house,

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,529
and I watched when you opened the coffin.

47
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,039
But it had nothing to do with Chu Chu.

48
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,999
I care for you only.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,659
Before coming to Qianzhou, my father gave me another mission.

50
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,719
He was concerned that there were remnants of the rebels.

51
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,850
He thought you might ignore your safety,

52
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,530
so he asked me to keep a close eye on you!

53
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,820
[To Jing Yi]

54
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,149
These are letters my father sent me.

55
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,950
Read them.

56
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,450
Why did you do those things without telling me?

57
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,650
Why do you think?

58
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,729
Would you have brought me if there were real danger?

59
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,680
Would you tell me?

60
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,060
Chu Chu, don't be scared.

61
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,719
I'm trying to save you.

62
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,130
I won't hurt you.

63
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,760
I brought you here to protect you.

64
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,560
You stay away!

65
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,530
Didn't you ask me before where this place is?

66
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,070
I'm telling you. This is where your mother used to live.

67
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,079
My mother?

68
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,780
Finished?

69
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,240
It's my turn to ask questions.

70
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,450
How do you know it was Xu Rugui who left you this hairpin,

71
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,620
but not Chu Chu who dropped it?

72
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,831
I knew there were two groups, based on carriage tracks and footprints.

73
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:01,749
They went in two directions.

74
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,469
I found the hairpin in one direction of the tracks.

75
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,090
He knew I would ask my men to search the whole lane.

76
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,060
He deliberately put the hairpin under a basket.

77
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,719
I gave the hairpin to Chu Chu only yesterday.

78
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,890
If Xu Rugui knew the hairpin, he must have known

79
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,919
about Chu Chu's parents.

80
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,230
I'm sure he left me the hairpin for a reason

81
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,020
When I figure out his reason, I'll know what he's after.

82
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,159
When I know what he's after, I'll follow his trail.

83
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,970
Then I may know where he took Chu Chu.

84
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,260
Purpose... Hairpin...

85
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:47,870
If you're right, I can really find something from the remains.

86
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,210
It's authentic Sichuan embroidery on the clothes.

87
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,269
It's not from an ordinary embroiderer,

88
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,319
but an imperial embroidery workshop.

89
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,069
It's not what common people can use.

90
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,230
And this hairpin...

91
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,340
My mother has a large number of hairpins of a similar style.

92
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,370
It's said that girls and ladies of rich families

93
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,690
wore such hairpins to compete with one another

94
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,540
ten or twenty years ago.

95
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,910
But the more popular they are, the faster they become antiquated.

96
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,340
After it went out of fashion, the hairpins were no longer used.

97
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,340
Among the clothes and jewels,

98
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,850
there's only something special about the hairpin.

99
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,549
I think she wore the hairpins out of decency.

100
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,150
Decency?

101
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,549
Your mother is a princess.

102
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,700
So, she's always dressed up based on imperial rules.

103
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,801
She doesn't need to be concerned about decency.

104
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:39,160
You don't know that for ladies and girls from rich families

105
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,340
what they eat and the clothes they wear

106
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,020
are not decisions they can make for themselves.

107
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,170
For example, look at the hairpin.

108
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:54,840
When it was popular, wives of third-rank ministers wore it.

109
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,060
Wives of fifth-rank censors also wore it.

110
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,419
If wives of fourth-rank officials didn't wear it,

111
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,069
when with the other wives, they would be mocked.

112
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,950
Their husbands would be disgraced, as well.

113
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,390
She could afford Sichuan embroidery,

114
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:18,400
and she had to wear something for decency.

115
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,330
It looks like she was the wife of an official in Jiannan.

116
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:29,700
However, her husband didn't seem like an official in the state or county.

117
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,610
He should have a higher ranking.

118
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,690
Then he would have precious cloth from an imperial embroidery workshop.

119
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,720
He was more likely to be...

120
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,770
Military Commissioner of Jiannan.

121
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,640
You know my mother?

122
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,159
Of course.

123
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,389
Your mother is the sister of Xu Zongfang,

124
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,759
the master of the Xu family in Guanling County.

125
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,320
Her name was Yixiang. She was the third child.

126
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,490
When she was 18, she married a military officer Yun Yi.

127
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,430
He worked very hard.

128
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,210
As a result of his military exploits,

129
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,670
he became the vice general to Chen Ying,

130
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,720
who was the Military Commissioner of Jiannan.

131
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,970
In the 8th year of Emperor Wenzong, he rebelled with Chen Ying

132
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,710
and killed Censor Xiao Heng who had reported them.

133
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,300
Xiao Heng is the husband of Princess Xiping,

134
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,370
and the father of Xiao Jinyu and Xiao Jinli.

135
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:35,420
The emperor was furious and sent troops to exterminate all rebels.

136
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,200
Rebellion is an unpardonable crime.

137
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,170
Their families should have been killed.

138
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,109
But at that time, your mother was pregnant.

139
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,270
To give birth to you, she ran away overnight.

140
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,680
In the Southwest, a disaster that could ruin a family

141
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,719
was very likely to be the rebellion of the Military Commissioner of Jiannan.

142
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,829
Looks like Chu Chu's father worked

143
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,759
for the Military Commissioner of Jiannan.

144
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,620
And Xu Rugui knew that before.

145
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,780
If Chu Chu's father really worked for Chen Ying,

146
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,250
his daughter should have been executed.

147
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,100
- Could she be—?
- No.

148
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,650
Xu Rugui may have left me the hairpin

149
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,910
to make me suspect that Chu Chu wanted to run away to escape punishment

150
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,470
and that she arranged the kidnapping herself to do so.

151
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,610
If I check the case in the way he wants,

152
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,370
I'll really make Chu Chu desperate.

153
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,229
No way! You're talking nonsense!

154
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,940
My father can't be a rebel.

155
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,709
He never killed His Highness's father.

156
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,230
You're the criminal. I'll never believe a word you say.

157
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,880
Xiao Jinyu proposed to open the coffin.

158
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,800
Isn't that so?

159
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,879
I knew it.

160
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,109
Xiao Jinyu came to the Southwest to find his father.

161
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,230
Since he met you in Chang'an, he's been suspecting you,

162
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,450
spying on you, and checking on you.

163
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,930
He also tried to make you trust him,

164
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:10,590
because he wanted to find his father with your help.

165
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,830
Since you two met,

166
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,330
he's been holding on to your pendant, hasn't he?

167
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,910
I know it's his father's pendant.

168
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,600
He's told me everything.

169
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,960
Don't you understand now?

170
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,639
You're of no use to him.

171
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,871
Given how capable Xiao Jinyu is,

172
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,840
by now he must have figured out who your parents are

173
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,880
from examining your mother's remains.

174
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,079
There's a blood feud between you.

175
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,010
If you go back to him, you'll be arrested as a rebel.

176
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,150
Or he'll kill you in a fit of anger

177
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,020
to avenge his father.

178
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,399
He won't do that!

179
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,810
I don't believe you!

180
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,389
Anybody there? Open the door!

181
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:06,249
Xiao Jinyu always has dealings with criminals.

182
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,220
He thinks of the worst, in case of anything.

183
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,930
When he figures out who your parents are,

184
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,340
he'll suspect that you ran to escape punishment

185
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:19,200
or even that you planned this yourself.

186
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,229
What does Xu Rugui want?

187
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,570
He kidnapped Chu Chu, for my father.

188
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,640
He set the trap and used the hairpin, to make it seem like

189
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,040
Chu Chu was escaping punishment.

190
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,810
If I fall into his trap,

191
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,100
my father's secret may be exposed.

192
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,110
Then I'll check on Chu Chu and look for my father at the same time.

193
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,980
I can hardly handle two things well.

194
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,319
And I'll take action.

195
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,340
Then he can deceive Chu Chu and make her think she has no choice

196
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,450
but to seek refuge with him and depend on him.

197
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:54,100
Eventually, he will ask Chu Chu for some clues about my father.

198
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,200
Isn't he considering too simply?

199
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,860
Chu Chu investigated Rugui House

200
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,540
and saw him try to kill us at the Guanling County border.

201
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,909
Chu Chu knows very well what kind of man Xu Rugui is.

202
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,820
Even if her father was indeed a rebel,

203
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,230
she wouldn't believe it at all if he told her.

204
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,750
I won't believe you, no matter what you say.

205
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,550
His Highness never wrongs an innocent person.

206
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,810
He won't wrong me for what I haven't done.

207
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:23,319
No matter why you kidnapped me, I won't listen to you.

208
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,250
I won't tell you anything or do anything for you.

209
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,570
I know you think I'm a villain.

210
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,130
But you know what?

211
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:36,080
These past years, I was forced to do evil things.

212
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,639
Chu Chu, I never meant to hurt you.

213
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,420
Since I knew you worked in Three Judicial Offices,

214
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,130
I've been trying to get you out.

215
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,319
But Xiao Jinyu sent men to guard you closely,

216
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,420
I had no chance to save you.

217
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,720
Then when I knew you and Xiao Jinyu were coming to Qianzhou,

218
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,380
I waited for you at the border of Guanling County.

219
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,520
Unexpectedly, I still failed.

220
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,330
Today, when I knew he asked you to open your mother's coffin,

221
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,279
I didn't have a choice, but to kidnap you.

222
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,930
Chu Chu, I did this to save you!

223
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,540
I'm not as smart as His Highness.

224
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,810
But I'm not a fool.

225
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,210
I work for the government, but you're a wanted murderer.

226
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,310
I have nothing to do with you.

227
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,600
Why do you want to save me?

228
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,690
Xu Rugui knows this.

229
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,900
He must have something up his sleeve.

230
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,690
Something more important than Chu Chu's trust in me.

231
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,370
Is that possible?

232
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,330
One kind of trust exists without any condition

233
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,430
and it can't be broken.

234
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,120
Does that really exist?

235
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,260
[On the ninth day of the first month, Xu Zongfang's sister came to him.]

236
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,740
It's the original trust, between family members.

237
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,959
Your mother is my own sister!

238
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,460
You...

239
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,610
You're Xu Zongfang?

240
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,200
I'm your uncle!

241
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,900
No way. You must have spied on me.

242
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,380
You must have heard us.

243
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,790
I won't be deceived by you.

244
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,540
I don't have an uncle like you!

245
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,880
Don't tell anyone about Chu Chu's parents.

246
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,380
All right.

247
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,370
Hey! Where are you going?

248
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,780
When you're in the Southwest,

249
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,250
you must protect Commandery Prince An at all times.

250
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,439
Also, if you meet any remnant of the rebels,

251
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,100
send me a secret letter immediately.

252
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,980
Father, what do you mean?

253
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,519
It's about the rebellion.

254
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,510
If it can't be handled properly, there'll be big trouble in the court.

255
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:42,220
If I know ahead of time, I can make preparations in Chang'an.

256
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,270
This is what His Highness never understands.

257
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,300
Chu Chu...  this is our old house.

258
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,640
Maybe you've never been here before,

259
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,999
but you grew up in Guanling County, you must know Butler Tan.

260
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,200
He's right outside.

261
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,610
I can bring him in.

262
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,310
I don't believe you!

263
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,710
You...

264
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,300
[Good Luck and Harmony]

265
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,000
- Your Highness.
- You may rise.

266
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,200
Deputy Magistrate Tan, I hear your father was the butler of the Xu family in this county.

267
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,680
You're right, Your Highness.

268
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,340
How old are you?

269
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,669
I'm... I'm 30 years old.

270
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,439
Had you seen Xu Zongfang before he moved away?

271
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,980
Your Highness, I was born in the Xu Mansion.

272
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,340
Before the Xu family moved away, I met Xu Zongfang nearly every day.

273
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,789
Do you remember what he looks like?

274
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:09,740
I'm afraid I cannot describe his appearance well.

275
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,300
But if I see him again, I would recognize him.

276
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,670
Look at this carefully and see if this is Xu Zongfang.

277
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,639
That's him.

278
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,370
He looks older than I remember.

279
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,780
But that's him.

280
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,180
Did he go back to his mansion lately?

281
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,100
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

282
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,140
To be honest, Your Highness, I've lived in the office lately.

283
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,370
I haven't gone back home, so I'm not sure.

284
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,980
Take me there immediately.

285
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,919
- Yes. This way, please, Your Highness.
- Please.

286
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,909
It's impossible! Impossible!

287
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:56,740
Chu Chu, what must you hear or what do you want to see

288
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,709
before you believe I'm your uncle?

289
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,520
I'm your real uncle!

290
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,050
Chu Chu, I asked the captured killers.

291
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,669
They were ordered to catch you.

292
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,420
Catch me?

293
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,999
Don't worry.

294
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,570
I'll figure it out.

295
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,450
But you must remember.

296
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,470
If someone takes you away alive, you're of use to them

297
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,250
only as long as you're alive.

298
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,439
They may want to know something from you

299
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,839
or want you to do something for them.

300
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,319
Don't be scared.

301
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,549
You must let them believe they can convince you

302
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,950
and make them put time and energy in trying to persuade you.

303
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,350
Then you can be safe.

304
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,980
And then?

305
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,109
Then run away if there's any chance.

306
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,999
If there isn't, stall for time until I come.

307
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,110
I recognize Butler Tan.

308
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,110
But it doesn't mean this is the old house of the Xu family.

309
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,100
You could have found another house and brought Butler Tan here.

310
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,980
You make sense.

311
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,980
I won't believe you.

312
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:03,430
Unless... Unless you tell me how my mother died.

313
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,930
I'm telling you, don't try to decieve me.

314
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,920
I inspected my mother's corpse.

315
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:15,830
Butler Tan, no strangers are here.

316
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,349
Just tell her the truth.

317
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,250
Yes, Master.

318
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,610
Miss Chu, your mother Miss Xu came to Master

319
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:29,690
all the way from Jiannan to seek shelter.

320
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,250
She said her family suffered from a disaster.

321
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,850
Master found it a bit strange and then had me look into it.

322
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:40,110
That was when we discovered what happened to your father.

323
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,690
What? Rebel?

324
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,589
It's a capital crime that means all families will be killed!

325
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,349
We can't let her stay.

326
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:51,229
If the government knows, we'll all be executed.

327
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,429
Yeah, Master.

328
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:55,450
We'll be killed for sheltering a rebel.

329
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,229
But she's pregnant!

330
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,950
So what? It's the baby of a rebel!

331
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,589
The baby will be killed, anyway.

332
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,080
Tan Hong, hurry! Kick her out!

333
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,750
- Yes.
- Wait.

334
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,229
Wait for what?

335
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,700
If we wait, the government will know!

336
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,030
Stop yelling!

337
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,550
I...

338
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,750
I have a plan.

339
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,450
In order not to get the whole family involved,

340
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,429
Master asked me to handle the problem,

341
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,829
because he was a good friend of the former magistrate.

342
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,500
Sister! Sister, it's me.

343
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,880
Brother? Butler Tan?

344
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,690
You haven't slept yet?

345
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,949
What did you come here for?

346
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,050
Sister, I know you had a tough life.

347
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,589
But I have my own difficulty.

348
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,130
Hope you can understand me.

349
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,900
Brother, what do you mean?

350
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,200
You shouldn't stand.

351
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,900
Come and be seated.

352
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:02,270
Without telling Master, I killed your mother with the latch

353
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,800
and hit her head to the wall, pretending she committed suicide.

354
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:16,949
Miss Chu, I had no choice... but to kill her.

355
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:20,440
We couldn't put the whole family in danger, because of her.

356
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,920
Master didn't know that before.

357
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,980
Chu Chu...

358
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,470
I know. I'm sorry for your mother.

359
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,189
I was too scared.

360
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,949
In case soldiers tracked us down,

361
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,410
I moved the whole family to Chang'an.

362
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:50,090
To make a living, I did evil things.

363
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,080
From now on, I'll make it up to you!

364
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,180
It was you...

365
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,250
You all killed her!

366
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,760
You killed my mother!

367
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,570
I didn't have a choice.

368
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,589
Until today, no matter what I do, I can't bring your mother back to life.

369
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:23,450
But, if you want to avenge your mother,

370
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,160
I can let you do that.

371
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,710
- Which one is it?
- Here we are, Your Highness.

372
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,060
Your Highness, it's Chu Chu's voice!

373
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,460
Be quick!

374
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,450
Tell me. Where's Chu Chu?

375
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,570
In the room in the backyard.

376
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,429
Father!

377
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,900
Xu Rugui killed him to keep the secret.

378
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,709
Tan Gui, how many back doors are there?

379
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,710
Three.

380
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,310
Chu Chu!

381
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,980
Master, here's a letter from Xu Rugui.

382
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,780
[Xu Rugui]

383
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,470
He has succeeded?

384
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,580
Have a look.

385
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,919
The female coroner is Xu Rugui's niece?

386
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,200
Isn't she the daughter...?

387
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,750
The daughter of a rebel.

388
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,740
How will you deal with her?

389
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,679
How?

390
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:50,159
Isn't it right to catch the daughter of a rebel?

391
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,390
It's wise of you, Master.

392
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:54,109
How shall I reply to Xu Rugui?

393
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,999
Don't reply to him.

394
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,210
Go and find Zhou Han.

395
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,360
Also, ask him to keep a close eye on the Antique Store.

396
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,060
Yes, Master.

397
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,230
I don't think the Antique Store is a simple store.

398
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,430
What? Send someone to kill Xu Rugui?

399
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,370
Go on. Keep yelling.

400
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,530
Do you think others can't hear you?

401
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,820
But... why does Eunuch Qin suddenly want to kill him?

402
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:31,309
Well, Xu Rugui took his men to ambush Xiao Jinyu in Qianzhou.

403
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:35,189
Unexpectedly, Xiao Jinli arrived in time.

404
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,110
Xu Rugui ran away alone.

405
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,199
His plan failed. What could he do?

406
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,700
He wasn't convinced, so he followed them secretly.

407
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,700
Guess what he found out?

408
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,180
The female coroner is a rebel's daughter from the Southwest.

409
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,490
Isn't that a good thing? Shouldn't he be rewarded, instead of being killed?

410
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:57,260
What if he's caught by Xiao Jinyu and he tells him everything?

411
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,660
He's big trouble.

412
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,600
Why don't we keep him, instead of killing him?

413
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,810
I don't think he'll betray us.

414
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,740
We have his families in control, don't we?

415
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,880
He doesn't dare to betray us.

416
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,970
I'm telling you. Eunuch Qin wants you to kill Xu Rugui, at all costs.

417
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,460
Along with his family. Kill them all.

418
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,069
I see.

419
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:18,280
Will I also kill Xiao Jinyu?

420
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,060
Sure. Of course.

421
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,190
Look how strong you are!

422
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,709
Xiao Jinli protects his brother with his soldiers.

423
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:29,150
How can you kill Xiao Jinyu with your men?

424
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,300
Don't be anxious.

425
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,280
Right now isn't Xiao Jinli in Qianzhou with his men

426
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,210
in order to protect Xiao Jinyu?

427
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,820
But Xiao Jinyu will leave Qianzhou sooner or later.

428
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,980
Think about it. Once he leaves Qianzhou,

429
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,720
won't you have a chance to kill him?

430
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,320
I understand.

431
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:52,970
By the way, Eunuch said, when you find the female coroner,

432
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,970
catch her immediately and torture her.

433
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:58,080
You must make her tell you where the Witch Doctor is.

434
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,469
After you find the Witch Doctor, take back his corpse.

435
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:05,000
Don't let Xiao Jinyu find him before you.

436
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,210
Here's another thing.

437
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,300
Eunuch Qin asked you

438
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,850
to keep a close eye on the Antique Store.

439
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:17,330
Chu Chu? Chu Chu!

440
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,919
Chu Chu!

441
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,330
What happened?

442
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,919
Grandfather, what happened to Chu Chu?

443
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,189
Father, what happened to Chu Chu?

444
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,600
I don't know.

445
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,500
She has a fever.

446
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,330
Chu He, go get a doctor. Be quick.

447
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,330
No need. I had a doctor check on her.

448
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,400
The medicine is in the kitchen. Please boil it for her.

449
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,350
Okay. Hurry, go.

450
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,820
If Chu Chu is in danger, I won't let you go!

451
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,480
What are you talking about? Go boil it! Childish boy!

452
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,409
Your Highness, he's too childish.

453
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,039
Don't be angry with him.

454
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,710
I failed to protect Chu Chu. He should blame me.

455
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,530
I should apologize to you.

456
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,330
Don't. Don't.

457
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,020
Your Highness, what happened to Chu Chu?

458
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:03,730
I was so careless that a wanted criminal kidnapped her.

459
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,709
The person your men took to the woodshed?

460
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,410
Yes.

461
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,580
Leng Yue!

462
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,860
What are you yelling for! Noisy!

463
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,280
Where have you been? What took you so long?

464
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,700
I heard you fought with Xu Rugui.

465
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,460
Are you hurt? Are you hurt?

466
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,159
Aiyoo! I'm fine.

467
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,860
Let me check.

468
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,680
Must I beat you to prove I'm fine?

469
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:04,029
No need. I'm glad you're okay.

470
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,480
Who's he?

471
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,459
Where's His Highness?

472
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:18,050
He's accompanying Chu Chu in the room.

473
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,350
Is Chu Chu all right?

474
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,950
She's all right. She was just frightened.

475
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,350
Then she passed out suddenly because she was depressed.

476
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,720
Depressed?

477
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,390
She has had a lot on her mind lately.

478
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:32,510
Anyone would be depressed in the face of so many problems.

479
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,550
Xu Rugui, I'll see how long you hold on.

480
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,749
Your Highness. Your Highness.

481
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,560
Let me stay with her.

482
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,790
All right. Son, it's getting late.

483
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,860
Go make dinner.

484
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,760
All right. I'll make some food.

485
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,400
I'm sorry.

486
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:27,130
I underestimated His Highness.

487
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,930
What do you mean?

488
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,030
Don't underestimate the water drops.

489
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,460
When it keeps dropping, even a stone will be worn through,

490
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,810
not to mention his forehead.

491
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:40,039
You mean His Highness wants a hole in his forehead?

492
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,640
What are you talking about?

493
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:48,089
I mean don't underestimate the dripping water.

494
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,619
A man feels the weakest in darkness.

495
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,340
At this moment, when he can't see,

496
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,430
he'll feel more vulnerable.

497
00:28:55,430 --> 00:29:00,250
Then we give him a repeated and fixed stimulation, he'll break down.

498
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,700
He'll tell us everything.

499
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,189
What you said even gives me goosebumps.

500
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:08,349
His Highness looks like a weak scholar and he talks very gently,

501
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,740
but he has cruel ways to torture people.

502
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,170
A weak scholar?

503
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,879
You didn't see how he went crazy.

504
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,690
Today, he pushed me to the wall fiercely and nearly punched me.

505
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,580
Looks like I've got more to learn from His Highness.

506
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,530
Learn what?

507
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,839
You can push me to the wall. But don't use water drops.

508
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:31,999
Why can't I?

509
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,159
When someone lies, I can use it.

510
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,209
I swear to you. I've never lied to you once.

511
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:42,189
Really?

512
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,690
Yes.

513
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,559
Let me ask you something.

514
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,590
What did you say to His Highness at the Yamen today?

515
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,879
I said a lot to him.

516
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,870
But I didn't complain about you. Don't worry.

517
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,410
Stop joking. Be serious.

518
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:03,219
After Chu Chu was kidnapped, His Highness immediately checked where she was taken away.

519
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:06,019
He then went back and asked you something.

520
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:07,679
Before saying anything,

521
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,920
he went to see Tan Gui with Xu Rugui's portrait for recognition.

522
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,130
Tan Gui recognized Xu Rugui and then we rushed to the Xu Mansion.

523
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:19,149
We found Chu Chu and caught Xu Rugui.

524
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:23,569
You also don't understand why His Highness can connect such clues, do you?

525
00:30:23,569 --> 00:30:25,040
I don't.

526
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,729
We saved Chu Chu and caught Xu Rugui.

527
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:33,380
But why did Xu Rugui catch Chu Chu?

528
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:38,219
What did you say to His Highness that he managed to connect Xu Rugui to Xu Zongfang?

529
00:30:38,219 --> 00:30:41,700
Also, isn't Xu Rugui Chu Chu's uncle?

530
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,100
Even if Chu Chu doesn't know, doesn't Xu Rugui know?

531
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:48,070
His Highness knows more than you have imagined.

532
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:52,439
But this thing concerns Chu Chu's safety. And some details aren't confirmed yet.

533
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:54,230
We can't tell you now.

534
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:58,709
All you must know is that His Highness has clever strategies

535
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:01,110
and all evil men are within his control.

536
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,980
All right, then.

537
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,420
You sound so mysterious.

538
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:09,850
I don't bother to know about your official secrets.

539
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,500
Why did you kick me so hard?

540
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,660
The medicine is ready. Hasn't Chu Chu woken up yet?

541
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,409
Go have some rest. I'll stay with her.

542
00:31:46,409 --> 00:31:49,630
Don't bother. She doesn't want me to leave.

543
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,400
I'll put it here.

544
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,200
If it gets old when she wakes up, I'll boil it again.

545
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,179
Thank you.

546
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:04,390
Please get her a basin of water, a pot of liquor, and a towel.

547
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,770
She still has a fever.

548
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:09,469
She'll feel better if I cool her forehead.

549
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,970
All right.

550
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,760
What else do you want?

551
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,829
The person in the woodshed...

552
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,400
What's his relationship with Chu Chu?

553
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,659
He kidnapped Chu Chu.

554
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:32,399
Why did he do that?

555
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,800
I'll interrogate him later.

556
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,399
Chu Chu, you're finally back.

557
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,279
Let's go! Come with me!

558
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,270
If Xiao Jinyu comes, it'll be too late to run away.

559
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,829
Rebels!

560
00:33:08,829 --> 00:33:10,229
I'm not! I'm not!

561
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,229
Your Highness, I'm Chu Chu. I'm not a rebel!

562
00:33:13,229 --> 00:33:16,279
Chu Chu, don't waste your time on him.

563
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,060
He's coming to kill you.

564
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,820
No, he won't.

565
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,200
Children of rebels must be executed!

566
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,519
I was wrong about you.

567
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,080
From now on, we're strangers!

568
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:35,339
If you surrender now, you'll have an intact corpse for the sake of our old friendship.

569
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:37,449
Don't be scared, Chu Chu.

570
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:39,289
I'll take you away.

571
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:42,539
Ridiculous! Do you think you can run away?

572
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:44,500
Somebody!

573
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,930
No!

574
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,000
No!

575
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,500
Chu Chu!

576
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,910
I am here.

577
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,709
Don't worry. Xu Rugui has been caught.

578
00:33:56,709 --> 00:33:59,580
You're home and you're safe.

579
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,010
Don't be scared.

580
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,779
Your fever is down. Are you feeling better?

581
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,080
Thank you, Your Highness.

582
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,900
I had a nightmare in which...

583
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,320
which you abandoned me again.

584
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,979
Now that I promised you, I won't break my promise.

585
00:34:35,979 --> 00:34:38,249
Chu Chu, remember.

586
00:34:38,249 --> 00:34:42,329
No matter what difficulty you have, I'll try my best to help you.

587
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:43,800
I don't have difficulty.

588
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,289
I just had a dream.

589
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:47,199
Remember that even in your dream.

590
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,300
I'll remember.

591
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,660
Take the medicine.

592
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,570
Chu Chu, you're awake?

593
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,459
Are you getting better?

594
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:13,260
Much better.

595
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,419
Your Highness, Xu Rugui can no longer hold on.

596
00:35:17,419 --> 00:35:19,629
All right. I'll go check on him.

597
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:22,359
Have something to eat before you go back for some rest.

598
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,860
All right.

599
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,999
Your Highness.

600
00:35:40,999 --> 00:35:44,200
Your Highness, it's wise of you.

601
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:52,470
Xu Rugui, I guess you know who I am.

602
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,290
Make up your mind.

603
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,359
You have only one chance.

604
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:59,179
Once you tell even one lie, you'll spend the rest of your life

605
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:01,920
under the water drops.

606
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:21,049
What? After killing so many people, you're scared of mere water drops?

607
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:23,020
Your Highness, I confess.

608
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,319
I'll tell you everything! Everything!

609
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:28,599
Please, please stop the water drops.

610
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,470
I beg you! Please stop.

611
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,799
I haven't had dinner yet.

612
00:36:33,799 --> 00:36:37,799
If you want to bargain, I can come after having dinner.

613
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:39,969
Don't! Don't! I confess!

614
00:36:39,969 --> 00:36:43,599
Rugui House... It belongs to Qin Luan.

615
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,229
He ordered me to kill you and catch Chu Chu.

616
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,230
I knew that!

617
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:52,419
Tell me! Why are there illegal copper coins with Qian Printing?

618
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:55,699
Qian Printing...? Illegal copper coins?

619
00:36:55,699 --> 00:36:58,060
I... I don't know.

620
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,949
I don't know. I don't know.

621
00:37:01,949 --> 00:37:03,800
What about Duke Chang?

622
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,920
What Duke Chang? I have no idea!
