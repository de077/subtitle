[Summon Military Commissioner Chen Ying to Chang'an with his troops.]

2
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:11,579
Although Father left some evidence,

3
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:14,129
it's still not easy to redress an old case.

4
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:16,509
Qin Luan and his eunuchs buy and sell information in Rugui House

5
00:00:16,509 --> 00:00:18,271
and monitor the court.
[The imperial stateliness is gone]

6
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:21,320
Chang'an is disturbed by Duke Chang.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,850
Qianzhou is even more perilous.

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,650
Take her!

9
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,809
I don't want to implicate Commandery Prince An.

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,610
- Minister Xue.
- I can only do my duty as a coroner.

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,999
Tell me the truth.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,520
When did you fall in love with Chu Chu?

13
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,430
Sir…

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,520
It's true that I haven't married.

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,939
But at my age, do you think I can't figure out

16
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:57,999
what is going on between you two?

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,780
The way you protected Chu Chu.

18
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,660
Jinyu, you lost your mind.

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,929
I dare not justify myself in front of you, sir.

20
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:14,010
In addition to the complicated situation, I did have a selfish motive

21
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,009
when I protected her today.

22
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,649
I know I was being unfair, but it's my own wishful thinking.

23
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,330
If you want to scold me, I won't have any complaints.

24
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,720
Well, well. I don't know what you are thinking.

25
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,009
There are so many noble girls in Chang'an.

26
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,899
Why do you have to fall for a coroner?

27
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:35,189
If Princess Xiping learns of it, if the emperor learns of it,

28
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,779
do you think a scolding is all you are going to get?

29
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,209
She's not only a coroner.

30
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,889
I know what you want to say.

31
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,109
Her biological parents were also officials.

32
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:46,929
But she was raised and educated by a family of coroners.

33
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,859
She even went to Chang'an to take the Coroner Qualification Test in the Three Judicial Offices.

34
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:54,059
Her being a survivor of the rebellious party has been widely talked about in court.

35
00:01:54,059 --> 00:01:56,039
Now everyone in Chang'an knows it.

36
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:00,379
You should know these taints of her are difficult to clean.

37
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,279
If you are going to make such a mistake,

38
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,860
I will have no choice but to take her away.

39
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,579
I don't mean to offend you.

40
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,129
- But right now, I won't leave her to anyone.
- You...

41
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:18,169
The so-called taints are what made her who she is today.

42
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,249
I cherish them and value them.

43
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,430
I don't see them as taints.

44
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,089
Besides, you were also born in poverty.

45
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,599
Your achievements are attributed to your own efforts.

46
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,599
I've been listening to your teachings since childhood.

47
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,729
I know that one's fate is not decided by God.

48
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,319
I never judge people by their family.

49
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,499
What you said today contradicts what you taught me before.

50
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,330
I'm confused. Please enlighten me.

51
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,409
Forget it. You've gotten more articulate now.

52
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,140
Thank you for giving me a chance.

[Episode 23]

56
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,919
I mean, I know you don't like drinking or socializing

57
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,109
but you can't afford to not eat.

58
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,829
Here. I brought something you may like.

59
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,610
Have a little bit at least.

60
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,410
Isn't this a spoon?

61
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,450
Don't touch it.

62
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,890
Who is this? Why are you drawing her?

63
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,729
This is Chu Chu's mother.

64
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,000
She restored her mother's original appearance based on her mother's skull.

65
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,340
I'm drawing her by her statue.

66
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,599
Oh, right.

67
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,039
She talked about it when the coffin was opened that day.

68
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,919
But I didn't expect that she could actually restore a person's

69
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,879
original appearance based on the skull.

70
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,599
Miss Chu is not an ordinary coroner indeed.

71
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,379
I wish she were.

72
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,149
If she were just an ordinary coroner,

73
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,269
she wouldn't go through so many dangers.

74
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,789
Living a peaceful and happy life can be a good thing.

75
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,130
I can't believe you actually said that.

76
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,599
Looks like Jing Yi is right about it.

77
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,249
Qianzhou is not a land of plenty, but it nourishes humanity.

78
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:52,110
I can't believe I heard you agree with Jing Yi during my lifetime.

79
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,929
It seems that it won't take long for you two to become the same kind of people.

80
00:05:56,929 --> 00:05:58,379
How can you compare him with me?

81
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:00,310
I'm much better than him.

82
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,119
Hurry up and eat.

83
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,030
If you don't eat it, I'll… I'll write a letter to Mother about it.

84
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:10,159
How is tomorrow's search for Xu Rugui in the mountain?

85
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,509
It's arranged now. Don't worry.

86
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,439
My boys didn't bring shame on General Leng.

87
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,719
They dressed up and have been searching the mountain these days.

88
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,340
Although they haven't found Xu Rugui, they have found some traces.

89
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,069
Do you have to go to the mountain in person tomorrow?

90
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,269
If you find Xu Rugui tomorrow,

91
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,510
you will go back to Chang'an immediately?

92
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,969
I heard from Jing Yi

93
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:37,770
that Leng Yue has been keeping an eye on you these days.

94
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,509
Since she knew the emperor wanted to grant us a marriage,

95
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,719
she has been haunting me like a ghost.

96
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,060
I guess she is still waiting outside right now.

97
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,199
Why?

98
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,210
She said if I dared to agree to marry her, she would dare to kill me.

99
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,269
What about Jing Yi?

100
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,070
He is drinking with someone in the front yard.

101
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Go get Leng Yue here.

102
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,259
My Lord.

103
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:17,960
Come in.

104
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,860
Leave us.

105
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,190
My Lord.

106
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,839
What's the situation in Guanling County?

107
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,380
Has the survivor of the rebellious party been arrested?

108
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,619
Not yet.

109
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,369
Not yet? Are they going to arrest her or not?

110
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:45,620
I just want to take credit for it,

111
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,639
but I got nothing except for all these injuries!

112
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,100
I made a fuss for what?

113
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,569
My Lord, don't worry.

114
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:54,499
Minister Xue is still in Guanling County. He hasn't left.

115
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:56,930
I think he has other plans.

116
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,499
I also found out

117
00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:03,409
that Commandery Prince An is going to search Phoenix Mountain tomorrow and capture Xu Rugui.

118
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:05,440
What do you think...?

119
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,550
What do I think?

120
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,379
I think...!

121
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,980
My Lord.

122
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,379
Send more people to keep a close eye on them!

123
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,500
- Go now!
- Yes!

124
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,889
- Hurry!
- Yes!

125
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,980
Xiao Jinyu is a scourge.

126
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,860
I have to figure out a way to get rid of him.

127
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,029
If you two don't want to get married,

128
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,999
you need to answer one question truthfully.

129
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,439
Not to mention one. I can answer a bunch of questions.

130
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,029
Is there anything unusual in the Military Commissioner's army recently?

131
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,229
I haven't been in touch with that person for many years.

132
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,899
How would I know if there is anything unusual?

133
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,460
Unusual? What king of unusual things?

134
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,909
Let me put it in this way.

135
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,750
During these days, is there any news about General Leng?

136
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,149
Any news.

137
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:07,220
Do you mean this marriage thing has something to do with General Leng?

138
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,750
It's he who wants me to marry Xiao Jinli?

139
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,979
It's still not very clear why the emperor wants to grant you a marriage.

140
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:18,379
But I'm sure it's related to the interests of the Military Commissioner of Qianzhongdao.

141
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,149
How come?

142
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,349
Everything was fine when I left the army.

143
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,149
There is no news from the army during this time.

144
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,050
This doesn't make sense.

145
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,499
That person and I are total strangers.

146
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,949
I will never agree to this marriage.

147
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,899
If he wants to force me,

148
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,589
I'll just give my life back to the Leng family.

149
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,559
Nothing is settled yet. Calm down and let Jinyu talk.

150
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,479
Leng Yue, you need to write a letter.

151
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,419
Write a letter? To whom?

152
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:50,100
General Leng.

153
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,199
What do you want me to write?

154
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,199
Any homely greetings will work.

155
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,339
Jinli, after Leng Yue finishes it,

156
00:09:57,339 --> 00:09:59,589
you get someone to send the letter to the barracks immediately

157
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,439
and present it to General Leng.

158
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,140
Homely greetings?

159
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,469
To sound him out.

160
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,909
Leng Yue, I don't mean to intervene in your family affairs.

161
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,249
But it concerns the security of the southwest border of Tang,

162
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:16,459
and also the safety of tens of thousands of people in the Southwest.

163
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:20,609
I hope you can help me, and also help Tang.

164
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:23,140
Don't worry, I understand.

165
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,269
But you need to write a draft first.

166
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,639
I will copy it.

167
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,339
I can't write any homely greetings to that person.

168
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,640
Okay.

169
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,709
Stop tidying up. Get me a cup of tea.

170
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,590
I'm about to choke to death.

171
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,200
Every time you come back at this hour, you ask people to cook for you.

172
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,520
I will tell Commandery Prince An if you do it again next time.

173
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,399
General Wu, there is news from Pingkang Residence.

174
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,139
Qin Luan is somehow investigating the servants in Princess Xiping's mansion

175
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:57,250
who were dismissed in the early years.

176
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,779
The servants who were dismissed in the early years?

177
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:03,609
Yes.

178
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:07,430
And it's the year when Commandery Prince An and General Xiao were born.

179
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,219
How is it going in Princess Xiping's mansion now?

180
00:11:09,219 --> 00:11:12,579
Everything is fine. No one came to make trouble.

181
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,739
Princess Xiping hasn't noticed it.

182
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:17,939
Should we warn Princess Xiping?

183
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,109
Keep an eye on Zhou Han first.

184
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,449
Wait for my news after I tell Commandery Prince An about it.

185
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,850
Yes.

186
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,830
To see him.

187
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,560
Not to see him.

188
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,410
To see him.

189
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,209
Not to see him.

190
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,999
To see him.

191
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,600
Not to see him.

192
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,809
To see her.

193
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:54,510
Not to see her.

194
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,399
To see her.

195
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,100
Not to see him.

196
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,799
Your Highness.

197
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,400
Chu Chu.

198
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,999
Your Highness, this is the medicine from Miss Leng.

199
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,360
She has something else to do.

200
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,759
I decocted it.

201
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,810
Take it while it's hot.

202
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,970
Thank you.

203
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,170
You...

204
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,570
Come in first.

205
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,840
Your Highness, I...

206
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,119
I'm ready for your punishment.

207
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,469
Ready for my punishment?

208
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,999
I promised you on that day that, after we found Sir Witch Doctor,

209
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,949
I would accept any punishment from you.

210
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,850
Get up first.

211
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,999
Okay, I need you to do three things as my punishment for you.

212
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,449
Whatever you want.

213
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,460
First, get up.

214
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,009
That simple?

215
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,349
That's… one of the three things?

216
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,800
Second, forgive me.

217
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,609
Is that a punishment?

218
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:32,029
It was my fault when Chu He fell in the water on that day.

219
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,340
- It's me...
- Well...

220
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,659
That doesn't count.

221
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,569
I lost my temper and made you angry.

222
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,459
I should be the one to ask you for forgiveness.

223
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:45,350
Okay, then let's forgive each other.

224
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,559
That's your mother's relic.

225
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,360
Do you want to see it?

226
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,160
Go ahead.

227
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,800
So, this is the color my mother liked.

228
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,999
I drew this based on her appearance you restored and these clothes.

229
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,150
I only finished the lines.

230
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,639
I haven't colored it.

231
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,889
Don't worry.

232
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,369
These things will be returned to you later.

233
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,720
My mother was so pretty.

234
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,239
She's smiling at me.

235
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,229
You are so smart.

236
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,030
If she were alive, she would be proud of you.

237
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,440
I'll send it to you after I color it.

238
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,810
Thank you, Your Highness.

239
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,950
Chu Chu, as for the third thing…

240
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,029
I don't know what my father went through over the years.

241
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:58,829
He was living here alone and suffering from illness.

242
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,080
His life must've been hard.

243
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,110
As his son,

244
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,519
I couldn't stay by his side and take care of him.

245
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:12,230
It was you who were by his side in his hardest days.

246
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,769
Chu Chu, thank you.

247
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:20,879
Your Highness, what are you doing?

248
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,319
I can't take this.

249
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,909
I should be the one to thank Sir Witch Doctor.

250
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,819
He didn't despise me like other people did.

251
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,199
He spent time with me, told me stories,

252
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,959
and encouraged me when I was a kid.

253
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,400
I'm really grateful to him.

254
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,050
I will never forget him.

255
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,780
And you.

256
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,900
Have you decided?

257
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,000
I...

258
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,809
I don't know.

259
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:59,910
You don't know because the court wants to

260
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,759
arrest you and convict you

261
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,089
and you are afraid you will implicate me and leave me in a difficult place. Is that right?

262
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:09,509
Your Highness, you can give me up to them.

263
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:14,770
I believe you will reveal the truth to the world.

264
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:21,280
I'll go back to Chang'an and stay in jail for a while.

265
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,449
I'm not afraid.

266
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,349
Chu Chu, think about it.

267
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,849
I just found out your identity a few days ago.

268
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:31,689
There are still many things to be verified.

269
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:35,739
But the order was already made in Chang'an thousands of miles away to arrest you.

270
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:37,880
Do you know what this means?

271
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,200
Someone is on to you.

272
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,979
On to me? Who?

273
00:16:46,979 --> 00:16:49,809
The Acting Chief Eunuch, Qin Luan.

274
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:54,650
He found your stone pendant and concluded that you knew my father.

275
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:58,790
Qin Luan is afraid that what happened back then will be revealed.

276
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,679
He wants to find my father through you and kill you both.

277
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,669
If you go back to Chang'an now, you are going to die.

278
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:11,879
Right now, there are many doubts in the case of the illegal minting of coins in Qianzhou.

279
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,790
A lot of people may be involved.

280
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,469
If I go back to Chang'an with you to protect you,

281
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,600
I'll fall for the trick of the person behind it.

282
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,209
Therefore, Chu Chu, if you insist on asking me to give you up to them,

283
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,499
you are leaving me in a difficult place.

284
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,359
What should I do then?

285
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,909
If you trust me, just stop worrying and stay by my side.

286
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,379
I know how to deal with my teacher.

287
00:17:34,379 --> 00:17:38,590
What we can only do now is advance and retreat together.

288
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,580
I'll listen to you.

289
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:57,320
Are you willing to come back to me and stay with me forever?

290
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,690
Of course, I do.

291
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,240
I'm willing to be your coroner forever.

292
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,189
Not as a coroner.

293
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:14,219
Chu Chu, I want to spend every day with you

294
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,560
and take care of you forever.

295
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,930
Will you marry me?

296
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,959
You want to marry me?

297
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,959
Yes.

298
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,840
♫  With your smile  ♫

299
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,470
♫ In this moment ♫

300
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:33,710
♫  Let me cherish this lifetime  ♫

301
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:36,219
The medicine is almost cold. You should take the medicine first.

302
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:41,099
♫  I have to worry about the end of this life  ♫

303
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,990
♫  I’m still young  ♫

304
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,680
♫  With my love not yet realized for you  ♫

305
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,630
♫  But I'm willing to be here for you till the end  ♫

306
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:56,000
♫  You can rely on me in this lifetime  ♫

307
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,420
Chu Chu.

308
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,229
What's wrong?

309
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,810
Didn't you go to apologize to Commandery Prince An?

310
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,510
He didn't forgive you?

311
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,650
Or he scolded you?

312
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,209
Don't cry.

313
00:19:24,209 --> 00:19:27,509
Tell me about it. Maybe I can help you.

314
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,620
How about this? Have some wine.

315
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,270
After a drink, you will forget all the troubles when you wake up tomorrow morning.

316
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,670
I'll drink with you.

317
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,200
Commandery Prince An proposed to me.

318
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,900
Did you say yes?

319
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,999
I'm willing to stay by his side as his coroner and stick with him.

320
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,759
I can do whatever he asks me to do.

321
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,379
But I can't marry him.

322
00:20:09,379 --> 00:20:11,229
Why not?

323
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,470
Don't you like him?

324
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,999
I know what kind of person Commandery Prince An is.

325
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,859
Since he said that to you,

326
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:28,690
he is definitely not just talking about it.

327
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,099
Marrying a man is not the only important thing in a woman's life,

328
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:34,640
but if you miss the one you love,

329
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,000
you will regret it for the rest of your life.

330
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,550
Think about it carefully before you make any decision.

331
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,949
Your Highness.

332
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:52,799
Why did you ask me to come here from Chu's mansion in the middle of the night?

333
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,230
I think I did something stupid today.

334
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,349
Then learn from it and don't do it again.

335
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,050
Your Highness.

336
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:06,570
I proposed to Chu Chu and she rejected me.

337
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,189
You proposed to Chu Chu?

338
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,809
You said that I have someone in my heart and I need to think it through.

339
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:17,389
I thought about it. The person in my heart is Chu Chu.

340
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,190
But I didn't ask you to propose to her.

341
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:26,540
How can I be with her if I don't propose to her?

342
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,999
When? What did you say?

343
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,950
Tonight. She came to apologize to me.

344
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,950
And I just confessed.

345
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,120
What are you doing?

346
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,850
I want to see if you're out of your mind. Who would chase a girl in that way?

347
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:44,039
You proposed to her and confessed to her too soon.

348
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,050
You scared her off. How could she say yes?

349
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:50,730
It looked like she really was scared off.

350
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,039
It's my fault. I should have taken you out to enrich your experience.

351
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:00,060
Look what you did.

352
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,080
Come on.

353
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,360
Let me tell you...

354
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,140
Master, what are you burning?

355
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,999
Aren't these the files we brought from Rugui House?

356
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:33,060
Now we have gotten rid of Xu Rugui.

357
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,290
Do we need them no more?

358
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:44,289
You told me that Princess Xiping gave birth to two sons in that year, right?

359
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:45,919
I told Zhou Han about it.

360
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:51,859
Tell me about the rumors in Chang'an again.

361
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:55,379
Normally, when a woman bears two children,

362
00:22:55,379 --> 00:22:59,929
it can be diagnosed by the doctor after six or seven months.

363
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:02,449
But the doctor who felt Princess Xiping's pulse

364
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:05,289
reported the good news to the palace

365
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:07,409
after Princess Xiping gave birth to her two sons.

366
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,329
At that time, Xiao Heng had left Chang'an for quite a long time.

367
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,669
Think about it.

368
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:16,480
How could the rumors sound good?

369
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:31,000
Go Ask Zhou Han to get some people to find them.

370
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:37,230
Make sure to bring them back to me alive.

371
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,929
Here are the clues.

372
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:40,979
Master, rest assured.

373
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,659
I'll ask Zhou Han to do it now.

374
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,660
Hurry up.

375
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,189
Why are you here?

376
00:23:48,189 --> 00:23:50,629
I asked the imperial cook to make some snacks.

377
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,329
I'm here to bring the snacks to Eunuch Qin.

378
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,849
Jinbao, come here.

379
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:56,450
Yes.

380
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,739
What a bootlicker!

381
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,460
[Guanling Yamen]

382
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,259
Yesterday, I contradicted you.

383
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:06,221
I was being reckless.

384
00:24:06,221 --> 00:24:08,989
You must think it over carefully.

385
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,199
Yes, I understand.

386
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
It's all ready.

387
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,689
Where is Vice Minister Jing?

388
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,290
Your Highness!

389
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,380
Your Highness. Something happened.

390
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,349
What's wrong?

391
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,349
It's my brother. He is missing again.

392
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,660
What? What do you mean again?

393
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,999
I noticed that Chu Ping didn't look right

394
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,349
when I was picking Chu He up.

395
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:39,139
I asked him and he knew that Chu He went out yesterday afternoon to find Xu Rugui.

396
00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:40,589
But he didn't come back last night.

397
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,020
Leng Yue has sent people to find him.

398
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,119
Ridiculous!

399
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,479
He almost lost his life last time because of Xu Rugui.

400
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,119
He is not fully recovered yet and he did it again.

401
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,510
Your Highness, my father said my brother was determined to

402
00:24:49,511 --> 00:24:51,429
get Xu Rugui back to redeem his mistake.

403
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:55,799
Otherwise, he would feel shameful and unqualified to work in the County Office.

404
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,900
Don't panic.

405
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,759
Only Chu He can find Xu Rugui in this place.

406
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,100
I've sent a lot of people into the mountain to search for Xu Rugui

407
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,379
and they didn't find him. Can Chu He find him on his own?

408
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,189
You mean Chu He is more familiar with this area

409
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,330
than the soldiers of the Military Commissioner.

410
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,829
It might be easier for him to find Xu Rugui.

411
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:18,349
Jinli's men didn't find him, but Chu He might be able to find him.

412
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,049
I've asked people to keep an eye on the few roads into the mountain.

413
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:26,750
I should've known it if he went into the mountain yesterday.

414
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:33,190
Unless there is another possibility.

415
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,700
Xu Rugui is not in Phoenix Mountain?

416
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,220
Not in Phoenix Mountain?

417
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,900
But Chu He said that he saw Xu Rugui going in the direction of Phoenix Mountain.

418
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,349
Xu Rugui is very familiar with this area.

419
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,999
I'm afraid that going in the direction of Phoenix Mountain

420
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,279
was just a smokescreen for those who were chasing him.

421
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,520
Chu He should have thought about it and figured out

422
00:25:51,521 --> 00:25:55,349
where Xu Rugui might be hiding, that's why he left alone.

423
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,309
Chu Chu, think about it carefully.

424
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:00,039
Is there any other hiding place in the county

425
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,480
where Xu Rugui and Chu He both know of?

426
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,960
The hiding place...

427
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,360
He was injured.

428
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,980
He won't keep moving.

429
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,309
I think he should be hiding in a place.

430
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,069
He may think when we think he has escaped from Guanling County,

431
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,709
we will give up searching this place

432
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,970
and head for somewhere else to look for him.

433
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,290
Then he will take the chance to escape.

434
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:22,829
So it should be a place where he can get water and food easily.

435
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:26,109
Maybe it's a secret place. Maybe it's in a busy area.

436
00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:28,350
A secret place in a busy area?

437
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,590
I know it.

438
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,290
The letter has been sent out?

439
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,430
What did you write?

440
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,999
None of your business.

441
00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:50,400
I...

442
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,230
Do you remember what I told you yesterday?

443
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,140
But I still feel a little...

444
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,719
But what? You must listen to me at this time. Trust me.

445
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:05,860
Go ahead.

446
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,930
Your Highness, it's over there by the big tree.

447
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,360
Come on!

448
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,249
We found him! Hurry up!

449
00:27:23,249 --> 00:27:24,270
Yes!

450
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,770
Brother.

451
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,040
Hurry up. Put him here.

452
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,570
Be careful.

453
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,200
Be careful.

454
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,160
Brother.

455
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,020
Come on. One, two.

456
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,640
Your Highness, have mercy!

457
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,020
Is my brother okay?

458
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,309
He's fine. He was knocked out.

459
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,439
Greetings to Commandery Prince An.

460
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,040
I got drunk last night and overslept.

461
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,210
Cut it out. What's this place?

462
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,850
Vice Minister.

463
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:07,399
This is a century-old tree, also the legendary Tree of Love.

464
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,980
Those who pray for love here will get what they want.

465
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,740
Your Highness, Xu Rugui lost too much blood.

466
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,200
He must be sent back to the County Office for treatment now.

467
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,149
Brother, you are awake.

468
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,179
Xu Rugui is still in the tree hole!

469
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,209
We found him. Brother, you found him.

470
00:28:25,209 --> 00:28:27,310
You knocked him out.

471
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,539
I knew he must've been hiding here.

472
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,199
There is food and drink.

473
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,699
It's also convenient to ask for information.

474
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:39,119
It's just that I was careless and didn't notice the moss by the tree.

475
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,289
You are not careless, you are lucky.

476
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,939
If he didn't lose too much blood,

477
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,759
do you think you could talk about being careless right here?

478
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,159
But it's me who knocked him out.

479
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,310
All right, let's get back first.

480
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,919
Your Highness, about my brother letting go of Xu Rugui...

481
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:55,500
He has redeemed his mistake. He is reprieved.

482
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,580
Thank you, Your Highness.

483
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,180
Take Xu Rugui away.

484
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,780
- Come on. Go.
- Brother, get up.

485
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,159
Your Highness, I have something to tell you.

486
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,840
What is it?

487
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,560
[Princess Xiping's Mansion]

488
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,999
- Your Grace.
- How is it going?

489
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,440
The imperial astronomer has matched the horoscopes of General Xiao and Miss Leng, saying they are a good match.

490
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,290
I'm afraid after Mr. Xue comes back and General Xiao is promoted,

491
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,970
the emperor will grant a marriage to them.

492
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,880
[Memorial]

493
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,739
Han Ji is so greedy for credit.

494
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,549
He has been trying different ways to ask me

495
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:59,979
to urge Xue Rucheng to return with the survivor of the rebellious party.

496
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,839
He is not young anymore.

497
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,160
For such little credit, his manner looks too bad.

498
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:12,139
Your Majesty, I think Minister Han's concerns

499
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,930
are not totally unreasonable.

500
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,739
This is strange.

501
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,590
It's the first time you speak for Han Ji.

502
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,929
I'm not speaking for Minister Han.

503
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:29,460
I'm worried about you.

504
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,209
Worried about me?

505
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:34,139
Then tell me what you are worried about.

506
00:30:34,139 --> 00:30:38,269
Your Majesty, Xue Rucheng was born in a humble family.

507
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,999
He got good grades in the examination

508
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,180
and got Senior Jing's appreciation.

509
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,410
Then he acquainted himself with Princess Xiping

510
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:48,010
and became Commandery Prince An and General Xiao's teacher.

511
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,980
Without those things, how could he become who he is today?

512
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,629
How do the things you said have anything to do with me?

513
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:58,979
Your Majesty, Xue Rucheng has a close relationship with Princess Xiping.

514
00:30:58,979 --> 00:31:04,879
It's possible that he has feelings for Princess Xiping.

515
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,200
Right now, he is in the Southwest

516
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,119
inspecting the military affairs of Qianzhou for Your Majesty.

517
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:18,030
If he stays there for too long and gets in touch with the Leng clan...

518
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,609
Your Majesty. Commandery Prince An, General Xiao, Vice Minister Jing,

519
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:33,370
and Leng Peishan's only granddaughter are all in Qianzhou.

520
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,380
We have to guard against them.

521
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:52,150
You are even more prudent than I am.

522
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:59,790
I just always bear Your Majesty in mind.

523
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,120
[Jing's Mansion]

524
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,060
[Father]

525
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:16,410
Master, what you have done is for avenging Prince Consort.

526
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:19,000
If he knew it in the underworld...

527
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,229
I feel guilty for Xiao Heng.

528
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:27,920
I have to finish the things he wanted to do when he was alive.

529
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,059
Master, if this matter is uncovered,

530
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:33,930
I'm afraid the Southwest will be in a bigger mess.

531
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,159
Leng Peishan concealed his illness.

532
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,039
Now there is illegal minting of coins in Qianzhou.

533
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,349
What he is plotting to have is not just military power.

534
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,429
If Leng Peishan is really up to something bigger,

535
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:50,640
doesn't that mean Young Master Jing Yi is in great danger over there?

536
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:53,430
At this point,

537
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,050
I have to take a gamble.

538
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,559
Master, what are you going to bet on?

539
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,270
He has a favorable geographical position.

540
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,780
I'll bet on timing and people.

541
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,399
I have asked the emperor to give them more power

542
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,760
in the name of dealing with the illegal minting.

543
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,980
I hope Commandery Prince An can play to the score.

544
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:16,930
It should not be too late.

545
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,859
I can only guarantee that he won't die for now.

546
00:33:26,859 --> 00:33:30,459
As for if he can wake up and talk, you need to find someone else to treat him.

547
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:34,289
Thank you for today. Go back and have some rest.

548
00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:35,830
Okay.

549
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,430
You've found Xu Rugui.

550
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,819
Why are you still staying in Qianzhou?

551
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:01,839
There is something unfinished in Qianzhou.

552
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,529
I must stay here and find it out.

553
00:34:03,529 --> 00:34:07,049
Jinyu, did you forget what I told you?

554
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:10,249
The longer you stay here, the greater the danger will be.

555
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:14,259
If anything happens to you, how should I explain to Princess Xiping?

556
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,759
Sir, if I don't solve it, I can't explain it to the court,

557
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,180
and I can't explain to my father.

558
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,329
Leng Peishan's affairs are military affairs.

559
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:25,399
It should be the Ministry of War that investigates it.

560
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,620
If there is anything special, they will ask Three Judicial Offices for support.

561
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,729
Even you are in charge of the Three Judicial Offices,

562
00:34:31,729 --> 00:34:33,520
you can't intervene in military affairs.

563
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,330
What I want to investigate is not military affairs.

564
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:38,810
Then, what do you want to investigate?

565
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:43,219
When Jinli's men went into the mountain to search for Xu Rugui a few days ago,

566
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:48,420
they found some sneaky people who didn't look like villagers.

567
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,150
I thought it was Xu Rugui trapped in the mountain.

568
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:55,100
But now, it seems that there should be someone else.

569
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,730
What are you suspecting?

570
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,629
Sir, do you still remember

571
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:07,399
the copper coins sent to you and Senior Jing by Wu Jiang?

572
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,129
Of course.

573
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:13,029
I found some illegally minted coins in Qianzhou

574
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:16,629
and asked the Prefect of Qianzhou, Li Zhang, to handle the case.

575
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:19,709
I suspect that those sneaky people in the mountain

576
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:22,220
are related to the case of illegally minted coins.

577
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:27,289
Military Commissioner's soldiers dressed up and went into the mountain, which made them panic.

578
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:32,619
Maybe there is an important clue in the Phoenix Mountain about this illegal minting of coins.

579
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:40,810
You do have to investigate it.

580
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:44,330
There is another strange thing.

581
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:48,279
When Li Zhang caught me on that day, I saw his hands.

582
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,359
Li Zhang's hands?

583
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,930
There were a lot of new and old small cuts on his hands.

584
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,220
Cuts?

585
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:01,850
According to Chu Chu, those cuts should be caused by small flat sharp tools.

586
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:05,810
Such wounds are often found on the hands of sculptors.

587
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,699
That's not strange.

588
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,760
I heard about it.

589
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,319
Li Zhang was born in a poor family.

590
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,059
When he was a child studying in the temple,

591
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,320
he learned some carving skills to support his life.

592
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,250
As far as I know, he hasn't given up carving till now.

593
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,529
I've also heard about it.

594
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,080
But I have a question about the minting of the coins.

595
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,699
You also saw that the fake coins

596
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,669
minted in Qianzhou are nearly the same as the real coins.

597
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,869
The coin mold was copied really well.

598
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,949
However, the official coin mold is so important

599
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,799
that even a prefect can't reach it at will.

600
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,810
But if someone who can carve stuff

601
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:49,389
and have access to the official coin mold, he can memorize

602
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:53,359
its details and size, and then copy it.

603
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,390
That makes sense.

604
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,640
You suspect that Li Zhang is involved

605
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,220
in the case of minted coins?

606
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,599
It's only my speculation now.

607
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,620
After we find their mint, everything will be clear.

608
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,660
I can't intervene in the affairs of the Three Judicial Offices.

609
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,040
You can decide for yourself.

610
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:25,080
But it's the emperor's order to bring Chu Chu back to Chang'an.

611
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:29,759
Either I take her back, or I take back the truth of Prince Consort's case.

612
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:32,000
Please forgive me.

613
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,599
Neither Chu Chu nor the evidence about my father's case

614
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,760
can be taken away by you.
