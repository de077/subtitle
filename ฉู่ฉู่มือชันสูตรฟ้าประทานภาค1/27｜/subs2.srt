00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:08,440
Timing and subtitles brought to you by The Imperial Coroners @ Viki.com

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,389
The superior of Li Zhang should be the so-called Duke Chang.

3
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:12,719
Your Highness, mercy!

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,609
You mean General Leng?

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,039
What?

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,450
Is General Leng involved in this?

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,819
I was just ordered to investigate the case of illegal minting,

8
00:00:20,819 --> 00:00:24,459
then the evil spirits thing happened.

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,739
It's too strange

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,340
and the timing is coincidental.
[Leng Peishan]

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,429
Is there any news from Zhou Han?

12
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,959
Where did he take Xu Rugui to?

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,050
Xu Rugui was taken...

14
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,489
Zhou Han got Xu Rugui?

15
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:47,219
Wait, Master. Hold on.

16
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,699
Zhou Han got Xu Rugui?

17
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:49,749
Yeah.

18
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,389
Zhou Han only said

19
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:54,439
he planted his men among the soldiers of the Shence Army

20
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:56,439
who escorted Xu Rugui.

21
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:59,960
But he didn't mention that he got Xu Rugui out.

22
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,280
What?

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,969
Master, that's a test.

24
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,349
You are testing me, right?

25
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:13,819
You think Zhou Han is incompetent,

26
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:19,930
so you secretly sent a professional to take Xu Rugui away. Right?

27
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,320
Idiot!

28
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,910
Master, what should we do now?

29
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,520
It has been Xiao Jinyu

30
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,269
who is vying with me for Xu Rugui.

31
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:39,150
Xiao Jinyu let Xue Rucheng

32
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,220
take Xu Rugui away.

33
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:48,090
Now those who got Xu Rugui hurt Xue Rucheng.

34
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,930
It's definitely not Xiao Jinyu who did it.

35
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:58,560
I'm afraid they are coming after us.

36
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,949
But who is so bold as to go against us?

37
00:02:04,949 --> 00:02:07,290
Except for Xiao Jinyu and his people,

38
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,990
who else dares to go

39
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:15,810
against me like this in Chang'an?

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,139
Do you mean it's the group of people under the banner of Duke Chang?

41
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:24,579
But why would they go against you?

42
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:27,519
What are they up to?

43
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:31,350
They are under the banner of Duke Chang now.

44
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,259
What do you think they are up to?

45
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,930
The vast lands of Tang?

46
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,170
Land?

47
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,349
Master, since the An Shi Rebellion,

48
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,629
the emperors come and go, but the Division of Eunuchs is always here.

49
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,960
No matter who ascends the throne

50
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,960
we are still the ones in charge.

51
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,889
I think you have lived a life of ease for too long.

52
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:02,190
You don't even know what death means.

53
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,929
Now, Xu Rugui is missing.

54
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:10,400
Our heads might fall off our necks anytime.

55
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,160
Do you understand?

56
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,329
Listen. Get your act together.

57
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:25,020
Someone will come to us soon.

58
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,119
Yes.

59
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:29,459
That's all you can say. Idiot! Idiot!

60
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,710
Master, watch your hands.

61
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:43,659
[The Imperial Coroner]

62
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,620
[Episode 27]

63
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,679
Don't cry out. Be quiet.

64
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,269
I'm afraid she is clumsy and she will singe my skin.

65
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,870
Your skin is thick enough. It won't hurt to singe it a little bit.

66
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,550
There are burn marks.

67
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,919
This is the bark of beech willow.

68
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,859
Put it on the skin and bake it over a fire,

69
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:26,749
there will be marks like bruises.

70
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,899
And you can't wash it off or wipe it off by hand.

71
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:32,939
It can only be wiped off with wine.

72
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,779
On the day I arrived in Chang'an,

73
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:37,029
I saw a fraud using this method to cheat people out of their money.

74
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,460
This is amazing.

75
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,020
Let me see it.

76
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,059
The mark looks like a real one.

77
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:49,419
But after he gets in the army, the army doctor will check his wound and it's hard not to be touched.

78
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:52,169
It's still different from a real one.

79
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,559
Please hold on, I haven't finished yet.

80
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,369
Chu Chu, here is the fresh croton you want.

81
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,810
You came back just in time. Give it to me.

82
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,530
Why do you need this?

83
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,710
What's wrong?

84
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,630
It feels...

85
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,560
warm and tingling.

86
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,819
Not bad.

87
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:32,419
It's exactly the same as the real one.

88
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,769
Miss Chu, it's my first time to know that coroners can fake wounds.

89
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,459
Actually, coroners don't do this.

90
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,459
Those who want to frame others came up with such a trick.

91
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,149
Some people try to cast aspersions on others

92
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:45,489
and try to rob them of their money,

93
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,719
they would use the beech willow bark and croton juice to fake a wound and go to the office to file a suit.

94
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:53,029
There have been several cases of such false accusations in the office of Magistrate Zheng.

95
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:56,569
There are some talents among the folks.

96
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,170
Your Highness.

97
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,049
With the swelling, it looks like a real burn mark.

98
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:02,999
Not bad.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,300
It can fool ordinary doctors.

100
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,139
I'll take a walk.

101
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,519
Vice Minister Jing, hold on.

102
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,579
If you want to pretend to be a wounded soldier with a broken leg,

103
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,549
only one injury is not enough.

104
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,799
Your Highness, how do you want Vice Minister Jing to break his leg?

105
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:19,449
It's just a broken leg. Is there any difference?

106
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:20,489
Of course, there is.

107
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,819
If you land on your face, there should be injuries on your face.

108
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:25,599
If you land on your side, there will be injuries on your arms.

109
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:28,000
But the injuries on your face

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,530
should be mixed with some real scratches to make it real.

111
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,289
Arm.

112
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,569
Those who are in the base of the Military Commissioner don't know what I look like.

113
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:36,969
General Leng has never seen me before.

114
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,389
I'm safe.

115
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:41,270
What's more, how can I get married

116
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,890
if I spoil my appearance?

117
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:48,000
Jinli, I need you not to tell anyone in the army

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,619
about Jing Yi pretending to be a wounded soldier and entering the infirmary.

119
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,529
Only a few of us can know it before we find out the truth.

120
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,969
Otherwise, Jing Yi will be in great danger.

121
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,279
Okay, I'll listen to you.

122
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,669
But why does Jing Yi have to pretend to be a wounded soldier?

123
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,209
Didn't you say that the army is strictly governed

124
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,939
and they don't slack off even when they are resting?

125
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:11,669
Yes. After such things have happened, I guess it's stricter now.

126
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,559
Therefore, among all the soldiers, those who are most relaxed

127
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,009
and have time to gossip and chat

128
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,609
are the wounded soldiers in the infirmary.

129
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,269
This matter happened very strangely.

130
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,499
We have to take information from all sides

131
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:26,720
so as to find out the truth as quickly as we can.

132
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,060
But even if he pretends to be a wounded soldier,

133
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,100
can Jing Yi make it?

134
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,679
Why can't I make it?

135
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,300
If I have trouble, I'll ask you for help.

136
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't even think about it.

137
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,999
There is one more thing.

138
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:44,529
Leng Yue. Miss Chu. There are regulations in the army

139
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:47,029
that normally women are not allowed to enter the barracks.

140
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,589
This time, General Leng wrote a letter to invite Commandery Prince An to come,

141
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:51,699
it should be fine that you two follow him.

142
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,330
But you still need to be careful.

143
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,490
Eunuch!

144
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,740
Eunuch Qin.

145
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,700
Eunuch Qin, I've been to the antique store

146
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,209
and checked the accounts and access records.

147
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,979
They are just some ministers who like these kinds of things.

148
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,100
There is nothing wrong.

149
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,020
Are you a cow in the horoscope?

150
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,479
I am not a cow. I am a pig.

151
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:48,480
Then, why do you need me to whip you up to take a step forward?

152
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,650
If you can't find out anything from the list,

153
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,559
can't you figure out another way to do it?

154
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,979
There are so many people going there.

155
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,249
Some go there more often and some go there less often.

156
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,230
At least you should...

157
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,760
know who goes there more often and who goes there less often.

158
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,860
Yes.

159
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,690
General Zhou, get some people to keep a good eye on the antique store.

160
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,080
There can be no let up.

161
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,640
If you make any mistake and ruin my business,

162
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:26,930
don't blame me for being ruthless to you.

163
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,549
Yes. By the way, Eunuch Qin.

164
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:32,530
I found something about what you ordered me to do a few days ago.

165
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,310
After some investigations, among those who left Chang'an,

166
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,359
some are dead and some are missing now.

167
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:40,709
I only found two people who are still alive.

168
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:43,659
One is a former maid from Princess Xiping's mansion.

169
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,639
The other is a former nanny.

170
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:47,639
I've made some arrangements

171
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:50,339
and the two of them are on their way back to Chang'an.

172
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,350
They will arrive in Chang'an soon.

173
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,660
Good.

174
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,610
Remember.

175
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,779
I want them alive.

176
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,679
Alive. Alive.

177
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,450
Eunuch Qin, take care.

178
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:22,960
Who are the bandits that are so bold

179
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,570
as to attack a minister in the capital?

180
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,489
The wound is superficial.

181
00:10:29,489 --> 00:10:31,219
I'm grateful for His Majesty's concern.

182
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,069
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

183
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,240
Don't neglect your wound.

184
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,780
Now it's easy to get smallpox.

185
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,809
You haven't gotten smallpox before.

186
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,979
If you are infected at this age, that will really put you

187
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,250
in a dangerous place.

188
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,659
I'll give you some medicine for preventing it.

189
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:54,640
If there is nothing important for you to do,

190
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,760
you'd better rest in your room.

191
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,640
See Doctor Zhang off.

192
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,040
Yes.

193
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,950
Doctor Zhang, please.

194
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,120
Manager.

195
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,699
How's he doing?

196
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:25,879
He was seriously injured.

197
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,580
After a long laborious trip, his condition is not optimistic.

198
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:37,249
Decoct the wild ginseng and feed it to him.

199
00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:40,769
Manager, that's the best wild ginseng.

200
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:42,389
He is so lucky.

201
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:45,779
Well, do you want to change your life with his?

202
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,039
No, no. I'll decoct the wild ginseng for him.

203
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,909
Don't worry, Manager Chi.

204
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:57,699
I will save Xu Rugui's life for His Highness.

205
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,289
This person is very important.

206
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:00,999
You mustn't let anything happen to him.

207
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:05,050
After we achieve the great cause, I'll ask His Highness to reward you.

208
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,401
Eunuch Qin! Eunuch Qin! You can't go in there!

209
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:08,789
Eunuch Qin! You can't go in!

210
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:14,110
- Eunuch Qin! I didn't know you would come. Sorry.
- Our master is not feeling well.

211
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,300
Your place is a little shabby.

212
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,559
Well, well. Look.

213
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:29,190
There is a sour smell of a useless scholar everywhere.

214
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,039
What brought you here?

215
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,320
I heard that you were injured.

216
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,890
By the will of His Majesty, I'm here to check your condition.

217
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,389
I'm grateful for His Majesty's concern.

218
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
The wound is superficial. I'm doing well.

219
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,730
Where did you get hurt?

220
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,230
It's this arm.

221
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,980
Where?

222
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,139
The emperor wants to know your condition.

223
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:07,820
I need to examine your wound, so I can report to His Majesty.

224
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,020
Am I right?

225
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,120
Yes.

226
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:17,249
His Majesty said Minister Xue accomplished nothing

227
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,639
during your trip to the Southwest.

228
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:25,620
You are an unusual talent in Tang.

229
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,700
His Majesty really doesn't know

230
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,400
whether you went to the Southwest to work

231
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,979
or to make a sightseeing tour with the money of the government.

232
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,919
I failed His Majesty's grace.

233
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,489
I deserve death.

234
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,820
Why are you still alive?

235
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,340
I have no complaints.

236
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,889
What a pity. His Majesty is lenient.

237
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:54,470
He doesn't want your life.

238
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,440
You won't die.

239
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,049
But you will be fined the salary of six months.

240
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:02,029
Do you feel wronged?

241
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:04,900
I'm grateful for His Majesty's grace.

242
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,659
Yeah, I forgot.

243
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,200
You don't need to worry about your livelihood.

244
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,299
As long as Commandery Prince An is still breathing,

245
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,560
he will reward you with something to eat.

246
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:34,929
You are so lucky to have such a good long-living student.

247
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:37,450
Thank you, Eunuch Qin.

248
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,879
Look what a coward you are.

249
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:47,660
I really should invite Princess Xiping to take a look at you.

250
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,669
Minister Xue, have a good rest.

251
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,160
I'll leave.

252
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,470
Take care, Eunuch Qin.

253
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,500
Bastard.

254
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,800
I won't keep you alive after I make it.

255
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,649
Manager. As you ordered,

256
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:34,659
the birthday gift for Eunuch Qin is prepared.

257
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,489
[Birthday]

258
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,690
Please have a look.

259
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,510
Good.

260
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,659
Very good.

261
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:45,759
Manager, Qin Luan is an old eunuch who has been through three dynasties.

262
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:52,160
Can we make him believe that we have Xu Rugui with just one Ruyi?

263
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,299
Even if he believes it, he may not be willing to cooperate with us.

264
00:15:56,299 --> 00:15:59,220
Eunuchs are slaves of the royal family.

265
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,929
They are just assuming the majesty of the emperor.

266
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:06,069
They don't care who the emperor is.

267
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:08,689
We only need to let Qin Luan know

268
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:11,189
that the world is still ruled by the current emperor.

269
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:15,250
Xu Rugui is an important witness who will threaten his power

270
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,020
in the Division of Eunuchs, even his life.

271
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,980
But if Duke Chang ascends the throne,

272
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,650
Xu Rugui will become an important link

273
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,489
between the Division of Eunuchs and him.

274
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:32,120
After we make this clear to him, Qin Luan will weigh the pros and cons

275
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,810
and choose to cooperate with us.

276
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,860
[Qianzhou Army]

277
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,850
Greetings to General Leng.

278
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,899
You may rise.

279
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,709
Jinli, you are finally back.

280
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:10,510
You have become stronger now.

281
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,629
- General Leng.
- Thank you for the efforts.

282
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,530
Commandery Prince An.

283
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,489
This matter happened so suddenly. Sorry to have troubled you to come here.

284
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:25,579
I didn't expect you to be here so soon.

285
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,010
I'm truly grateful.

286
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,250
Please don't say that.

287
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,400
I'm General Zhao Jie.

288
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,309
I'm General Hou Bin.

289
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,799
Greetings to Commandery Prince An.

290
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,600
You may rise.

291
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,440
This is...

292
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,280
This is my coroner.

293
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,370
Greetings to General Leng.

294
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:54,430
To my surprise, your coroner is a girl.

295
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,410
This girl is...

296
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,040
A charwoman.

297
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,540
Leng Yue!

298
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,640
This is the granddaughter of General Leng.

299
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,809
Sorry for being disrespectful.

300
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,430
What's respectable about the granddaughter of General Leng?

301
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,110
General Leng.

302
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:42,309
This little soldier wears our uniform,

303
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:46,129
but he doesn't look like one of our men.

304
00:18:46,129 --> 00:18:48,309
General Leng, this is a Qianzhou's soldier

305
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:50,680
rescued by us from a group of bandits on our way here.

306
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,170
He was severely injured and we were in a hurry to come here.

307
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:58,330
So we changed his clothes and brought him here for treatment.

308
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:07,799
I saved him. Sorry for bringing you trouble.

309
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,889
Take this Qianzhou's soldier to the infirmary for treatment.

310
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:25,590
Yes.

311
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,650
Come with me.

312
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,919
Commandery Prince An, please.

313
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,159
General Leng, please.

314
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,660
Please.

315
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,100
There are more people with malignant sores recently.

316
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,860
We need to get more medicinal materials for malignant sores

317
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,909
or we'll be running around looking for medicinal matterials when we run out of them.

318
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,049
Okay. Make a list for me.

319
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:52,760
- Okay.
- I'll go and check the storeroom.

320
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,019
If there are not enough crude drugs, I'll ask someone to buy more.

321
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,980
- General.
- General.

322
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,859
- Guys.
-  General Xiao, when did you come back?
- I've Just arrived.

323
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:09,339
Listen. This is a Qianzhou soldier I saved on my way here.

324
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:11,730
He is severely injured and has had quite a scare.

325
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,749
General Leng asked me to bring him here for treatment.

326
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,079
I'll send him back after he gets better.

327
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,669
It's scary to be a soldier.

328
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,370
I heard that Qianzhou's soldiers are as weak as chickens

329
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,079
and as timid as mice.

330
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,180
Today, I finally see one alive.

331
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,650
I think he is half dead.

332
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,279
All right.

333
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,070
Watch your words. Don't you feel shameful?

334
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,969
You two, stop standing there.

335
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,440
Help him to bed.

336
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,700
It hurts. It hurts.

337
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:10,579
Your Highness, please don't mind
[Assembly Hall]

338
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:15,180
the poor conditions here.

339
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,929
No need to say that.

340
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:21,199
In your letter, you summarized what happened here in a few words.

341
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,480
Can you elaborate on the whole situation for me?

342
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,519
Hou Bin.

343
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,909
Yes.

344
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,109
You tell him.

345
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,610
Yes.

346
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,359
Your Highness. About half a month ago,

347
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:37,619
something very strange happened in the army all of a sudden.

348
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,939
From time to time, there would be some soldiers who would suddenly go crazy.

349
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,229
Some of them are less ill.

350
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,319
They would just go crazy and talk nonsense that no one could understand.

351
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,979
After they woke up, they became normal again.

352
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,319
But they forgot everything they said and did when they went crazy.

353
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,109
Some soldiers are more seriously ill.

354
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:59,460
They killed themselves in madness for no reason.

355
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,429
That's why General Leng presumes

356
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:06,010
that there are evil spirits behind it?

357
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,070
Your Highness. As for the evil spirits,

358
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,000
it was an idea of mine and General Hou.

359
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:20,499
I really don't know how to deal with it.

360
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,649
A few days ago, General Yunhui, Xu Ping,

361
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:27,850
jumped into the fire in public and was burned alive in front of us.

362
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,770
Everyone was startled by the scene.

363
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,410
If we don't find out what's happening here,

364
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,199
I'm afraid there will be a big mess.

365
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,610
Besides, he did look like he was possessed by an evil spirit.

366
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,210
All right.

367
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,419
I wrote the letter.

368
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,540
It's my presumption.

369
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,800
Since Commandery Prince An is here now,

370
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,600
I think you also want to find out the truth.

371
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,199
General Hou.

372
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,210
Yes.

373
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,849
How many people have gone crazy?

374
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:02,949
How many people committed suicide?

375
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:05,180
About seventeen or eighteen people have gone crazy.

376
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,909
Three people committed suicide.

377
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,669
Do you have a list or any statements?

378
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:13,969
Yes. General Leng ordered me to take statements of all the witnesses

379
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,719
and survivors.

380
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,040
I will present you the papers later.

381
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,970
Where are the bodies of the deceased?

382
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,760
They are placed in a camp.

383
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,189
Chu Chu, go and take a look with Leng Yue.

384
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,530
- Yes.
- Hold on.

385
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:37,490
Your Highness, Miss Chu is your coroner.

386
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,179
She needs to do autopsies.

387
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:45,380
But Leng Yue is just a girl goofing around.

388
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,620
I don't think it's proper to let her get involved in this case.

389
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,550
What's improper?

390
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:56,849
Are you afraid even a girl goofing around like me

391
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,800
can see through your lie?

392
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,969
Nonsense!

393
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,470
Leng Yue.

394
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,880
Don't be rude in the army.

395
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,330
General Leng, since we agreed

396
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,199
that the priority is to let me find out the truth.

397
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:14,360
Then please let my people do their work.

398
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,920
General, please rest assured.

399
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,880
Even if it were witchcraft, evil can never beat good.

400
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,800
Zhao Jie.

401
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,900
Yes.

402
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,869
Take them to the mortuary.

403
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:36,270
Yes.

404
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,090
Miss Chu. Miss Leng.

405
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,590
Please.

406
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,060
[Assembly Hall]

407
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,510
Your Majesty, please enjoy the Zisun Tea from Huzhou.

408
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:17,819
Qin Luan. Your birthday is in a few days, right?

409
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:19,370
Yes.

410
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:24,169
I'm truly grateful that Your Majesty still remembers my birthday.

411
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:27,000
You have been serving me for a long time.

412
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,109
How can I not even remember that?

413
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,709
Since your birthday is around,

414
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,700
you will need to buy some auspicious things.

415
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,409
I will reward you with a hundred taels of gold

416
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,170
and allow you to celebrate your birthday outside the palace.

417
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,130
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

418
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:46,189
What's more, you have been the head of the Division of Eunuchs for some time.

419
00:25:46,189 --> 00:25:51,430
I'll ask someone to draft an edict and promote you on your birthday.

420
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,190
Thank you, Your Majesty.

421
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:59,640
I will repay your grace with my earnest efforts.

422
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,560
Jinbao, keep a close eye on him.

423
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,589
Let me know immediately if you have any news.

424
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,190
Yes.

425
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,890
Your Highness.

426
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,489
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.
- You may rise.

427
00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:31,440
Chu Chu, how did it go?

428
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,699
It can be basically determined that the three deceased men

429
00:26:33,699 --> 00:26:36,270
were drowned, strangled, and burned.

430
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:39,989
The first man had strangulation marks above his pomum adami (Adam's apple). His hyoid was broken.
[Neck Strangulation marks]

431
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:41,919
He died of strangulation.

432
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,899
The second man had a bulging belly.

433
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,599
There was a small amount of blood foam deep in his nose and mouth.

434
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,720
He was drowned.

435
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,179
The third man's limbs were scorched black and curled.

436
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,640
There was soot in his mouth and nose. He was burned to death.

437
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,090
There is no trace of struggling and fighting before they died.

438
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,459
General Zhao said there are

439
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,680
witnesses who saw them killing themselves.

440
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,489
But I can't tell it from their bodies.

441
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:04,160
I don't know if they really committed suicide.

442
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,079
Your Highness, the generals and soldiers

443
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:11,460
all saw them committing suicide.

444
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,359
Does Miss Chu not trust my words?

445
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,559
I can swear with my life that every word I said is true.

446
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,180
It's not that Miss Chu doesn't trust you.

447
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,970
As a coroner, she can't draw a conclusion

448
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,619
from the things she doesn't find in the bodies.

449
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:28,390
Please try to understand.

450
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,540
I was in a hurry to defend myself.

451
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,240
Sorry for my rudeness.

452
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:37,269
Your Highness, even there are witnesses who saw them committing suicide in public,

453
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:39,190
there is something strange with this.

454
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,520
Why do you say that?

455
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,699
Among these three men, the lowest officer is still a sixth-rank military officer.

456
00:27:43,699 --> 00:27:46,039
The three of them must all be good fighters.

457
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,370
If they want to kill themselves, there are many quick ways to do it.

458
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,309
Why would one of them strangle himself,

459
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,709
the other drown himself in the tub,

460
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:55,900
and the last one of them jump into the fire and burn himself alive?

461
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,419
These ways are painful and troublesome.

462
00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:00,709
Why didn't they just use their swords?

463
00:28:00,709 --> 00:28:04,059
I think even they killed themselves, they didn't do it voluntarily.

464
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:07,659
I think General Leng also has doubts about it.

465
00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:10,980
That's why he asked Commandery Prince An to come.

466
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,309
He has doubts?

467
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:14,330
He has doubts that they didn't commit suicide voluntarily?

468
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,639
Of course, he would say that.

469
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,640
Didn't he say there are evil spirits?

470
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,540
They didn't commit suicide if they were possessed by evil spirits.

471
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,419
Chu Chu, what's wrong?

472
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:30,129
Nothing. When Miss Leng said the ways they died are painful,

473
00:28:30,129 --> 00:28:32,260
I feel that something is wrong.

474
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,739
But I don't know what it is.

475
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:36,319
Your Highness, can I carry out an autopsy?

476
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,220
Autopsy?

477
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,470
To cut them apart?

478
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,660
Your Highness, well...

479
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,589
General Zhao, everything concerning the investigation

480
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,399
will be decided by me.

481
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,679
Thank you for bringing them to the mortuary.

482
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,280
If you have other official duties, you can leave now.

483
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,910
In that case,

484
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,650
I'll leave.

485
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,059
Go ahead and do it.

486
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,240
I'll have someone send you the approval letter later.

487
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,059
Thank you, Your Highness.

488
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,520
It should be them to thank you.

489
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,059
Be careful.

490
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,660
Don't worry.

491
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,989
Leave us.

492
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,590
Yes.

493
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:42,370
- How's it going?
- Your Grace, it's been verified they found two people.

494
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,249
One is a maid who once served you in the mansion.

495
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,899
The other is a wet nurse from the palace.

496
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:51,159
The two of them have left where they live and are on their way to Chang'an with them.

497
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:52,630
Who is looking for them?

498
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,880
Not clear yet.

499
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:58,100
I heard from the guards who investigated it that they left the palace.

500
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:02,430
Could it be...? Qin Luan?

501
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:05,599
Anyway, we can't let two of them enter Chang'an.

502
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,849
Yes.

503
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,519
Take a look.

504
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:12,490
Good stuff, take a look.

505
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,190
Hurry!

506
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,930
Do you want to die?

507
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,239
Someone stole treasures from Princess Xiping's mansion and fled.

508
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:30,800
We are here to search all the suspicious vehicles.

509
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,589
It's Princess Xiping's order.

510
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,540
I dare not disobey.

511
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,370
Please, Madam.

512
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,800
They are from Pingkang Residence. I took them out last night for a party.

513
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,450
Madam, please don't mind.

514
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,400
Madam, take care!

515
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,850
How is it going?

516
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,480
We stopped the carriage.

517
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,339
Our people had been following them all the way.

518
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:25,679
But somehow they changed the people in the carriage.

519
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,819
There were only two prostitutes inside.

520
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,520
What?

521
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,460
Guard them well.

522
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:41,819
Master, the procuress took them down and got them settled.

523
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,110
What a surprise.

524
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:49,349
Master, the rumors turn out to be true.

525
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:53,309
Xiao Jinli and Xiao Jinyu, one of them was adopted,

526
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:57,579
the other is her biological son. It's pity that the former servants in Princess Xiping's mansion

527
00:31:57,579 --> 00:32:00,579
don't know which one was adopted.

528
00:32:00,579 --> 00:32:05,190
I don't care which of them was adopted.

529
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:14,320
What I care about is where the adopted son came from.

530
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,999
Send people to find out all the newborn babies in that year

531
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,610
that might be adopted by Princess Xiping.

532
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,959
It's a little too hard for me.

533
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:29,739
How many babies were born in Chang'an City in that year?

534
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,469
How to find them out?

535
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:35,400
Do whatever you can.

536
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,370
Think about it.

537
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:45,699
If Princess Xiping wants to adopt a child, she can do it above board.

538
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:50,429
Why would she take so much effort and do it secretly?

539
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:55,810
There must be something strange about it.

540
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,210
The child adopted by Princess Xiping

541
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:03,130
must not be from an ordinary family.

542
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:06,999
Either it's Princess Xiping's close friend or relative,

543
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,350
or it has some relationship with Xiao Heng.

544
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:18,820
Maybe he is another survivor of the rebellious party.

545
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:23,010
I remember the wife of the rebellious party's leader, Chen Ying,

546
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:26,820
was close with Princess Xiping.

547
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,329
She died of dystocia back then.

548
00:33:30,329 --> 00:33:34,910
But wasn't the child never born?

549
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:45,040
Wasn't that female coroner pulled out from a dead woman?

550
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,400
Go to check the Chen family first.

551
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,379
Find out the truth.

552
00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:55,450
Then we can convict them of deceiving the emperor.

553
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,409
This is a good idea.

554
00:33:59,409 --> 00:34:02,190
Master, you are impressive.

555
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,530
You are wise indeed.

556
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,899
How are you doing, Jinyu? Are you used to living here?

557
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:12,269
We got everything in the barracks.

558
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,610
But it's just cold at night.

559
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,469
I got you extra bedding.

560
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:19,079
Just tell me if you need anything else.

561
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,440
Don't make yourself uncomfortable.

562
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,599
Every time you wrote a letter to us,

563
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,429
you said you were living well in the army

564
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,820
and it was no different from home.

565
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,730
Why would I feel uncomfortable here?

566
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:34,060
Did you lie to Mother and me?

567
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,959
I give up. You can live here as you want.

568
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,439
I've checked the things you asked me.

569
00:34:43,439 --> 00:34:45,559
During the days before we went to the mountains with Li Zhang,

570
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,839
they did send a team of soldiers to Qianzhou to buy supplies.

571
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,850
What supplies?

572
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,219
Some commonly used medicinal matterials.

573
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:54,580
I confirmed with Wu Chen, the secretary in charge of military supplies.

574
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,390
He said there was such a thing.

575
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,550
There is a shortage of medicinal materials in the changeover period.

576
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,790
The nearby county doesn't have much medicine.

577
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:03,540
They are afraid buying too many medicines will affect the life of the people.

578
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,880
So they went to Qianzhou to buy them.

579
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,529
Has this team of soldiers come back?

580
00:35:09,529 --> 00:35:11,030
Not yet.

581
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,680
This is the list of soldiers sent out.

582
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,980
[List]

583
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:34,020
Secretary in charge of the military supplies.

584
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:39,569
He should be the one who can contact the people of the local office most frequently, right?

585
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:42,940
Yes. Are you suspecting him?

586
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,629
It's impossible.

587
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,759
Although he is in charge of buying supplies, he has no power to deploy troops.

588
00:35:48,759 --> 00:35:51,219
He reports these things to General Leng.

589
00:35:51,219 --> 00:35:54,359
General Leng will use his discretion and assign the task to the next person.

590
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:58,020
He can't decide who will be sent out.
