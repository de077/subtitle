Timing and subtitles brought to you by The Imperial Coroners @ Viki.com

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,029
The Prefect's mansion is on fire.

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,530
Take me there.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,719
Once Li Zhang was into trouble,

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,529
then the people who dressed like soldiers of the Military Commissioner

6
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:16,500
set the Prefect's Mansion on fire.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,400
Jing Yi got poisoned and went crazy the night he entered the military camp.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,240
I assume Duke Chang is related to it.

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,530
Your Highness, it's datura flower.

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,490
Is there something hiding about General Leng's illness?

11
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,639
Chu Chu, do you still remember

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,509
the two people who tried to kill Xu Rugui?

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,709
Yes.

14
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:49,119
I remember you said after the autopsy that they were both soldiers.

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,149
Your Highness, why do you mention this?

16
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,719
These people are also soldiers.

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,279
Jinli found out that before we went into the mountain with Li Zhang,

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,699
more than twenty soldiers left the camp to buy supplies

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,789
under Wu Chen's order.

20
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,849
This is exactly the number of soldiers who showed up in the Prefect's mansion.

21
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,439
But Wu Chen doesn't have the power to dispatch troops.

22
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,649
Therefore, it must be someone very powerful behind this.

23
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:19,279
What's more, from the traces of the scene in the wood house that day,

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,569
except for the Shence Army who came to kill Xu Rugui,

25
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:24,809
there was another group of people who wanted to capture Xu Rugui alive.

26
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,329
Your Highness, why do you think

27
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:30,479
it's General Leng who sent people to arrest Xu Rugui?

28
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,430
It's just my speculation.

29
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,069
At this point, if they want Xu Rugui,

30
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,580
it must be for his value as a bargaining chip

31
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,400
instead of his identity.

32
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,839
I shouldn't say these things to bore you.

33
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:56,180
It's late. Go to bed.

34
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,090
I want to stay with you.

35
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:07,079
[The Imperial Coroner]

36
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,130
[Episode 29]

37
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,059
Jinyu, I've found out that it was Hou Bin who sent those people out to buy herbs.

38
00:02:17,059 --> 00:02:20,100
They used to be bandits and they were incorporated into the army.

39
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,920
Take me to him.

40
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,110
This one.

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,359
My child... My child...!

42
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,860
Hou Bin!

43
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,880
Hou Bin!

44
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,119
Hou Bin! Hou Bin!

45
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,769
- Get a doctor now!
- Yes!

46
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:07,710
- Hou Bin. Hou Bin!
- My child...

47
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,209
- Hang in there.
- My child...

48
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,070
Hou Bin! Hou Bin!

49
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,379
Hou Bin!

50
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,020
What happened?

51
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,770
I'm late.

52
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,060
He stabbed himself.

53
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,240
If I had come earlier,

54
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,240
I could have stopped him.

55
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,259
Chu Chu, can you find out what he just ate?

56
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,379
There is no food residue in his mouth.

57
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,420
I can't tell now.

58
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,549
Have you two been guarding here?

59
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,139
Yes, Your Highness.

60
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:59,829
Has anyone been here after General Hou came back?

61
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,299
No.

62
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:03,130
After General Hou came back from the infirmary,

63
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,899
he has been staying in the barracks by himself.

64
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,459
The two of us are keeping watch outside.

65
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,260
We never left.

66
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,480
What's going on here?

67
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,489
General Hou was poisoned.

68
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,290
Poisoned?

69
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,219
Chu Chu, examine his body carefully

70
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:27,400
and find the source of his toxins as soon as possible.

71
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,119
Your Highness, General Hou's belly has been cut open by himself.

72
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,589
The evidence may disappear in a while.

73
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,830
Can I perform an autopsy on him now?

74
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,019
Autopsy?

75
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:41,699
How can you cut him while his remains are scarcely cold yet?

76
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,800
What are you yelling about?

77
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,029
Don't you know the military rules?

78
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,469
How dare you obstruct Commandery Prince An's investigation?

79
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,099
- Get out and take fifty floggings!
- Yes.

80
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:52,549
Hold on.

81
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,459
General Leng, they are not obstructing the investigation.

82
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:58,279
No relatives or friends of the deceased

83
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,520
are willing to let anyone perform an autopsy on the deceased.

84
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,579
But General Hou was murdered.

85
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:09,150
I promise I will restore his body after the autopsy.

86
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,219
We've known our mistakes. We are willing to be punished.

87
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,549
Take General Hou to the mortuary first, then take your punishment.

88
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,050
Yes.

89
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,280
Miss Chu, please.

90
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,369
Hou, how is your injury now?

91
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,510
When did you get injured again?

92
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,749
Just a flesh wound.

93
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,679
It doesn't matter.

94
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,999
How does it not matter?

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,549
Isn't it your flesh?

96
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,580
It doesn't matter?

97
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,009
I heard from Wu Chen that your injury hasn't healed yet.

98
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,589
You are even having malignant sores.

99
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,239
You don't even apply the ointment Doctor Qi gave you on time.

100
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,299
Are you trying to show how tough you are or are you just stupid?

101
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:35,579
All right. All right.

102
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,170
You two big men are even more naggy than my wife.

103
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,730
It doesn't look like an arrow made by the Tang armies.

104
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,330
No, this was used by the bandits.

105
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,029
I was young and aggressive when I just joined the army.

106
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,469
I followed Hou Bin to suppress the bandits once.

107
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,589
I was eager to make achievements and I fell for their trick.

108
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:15,460
Hou Bin got shot by many arrows upon saving me.

109
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:21,400
This arrow was so close to his heart that he missed death by an inch.

110
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,739
I wanted to keep this arrow to remind myself.

111
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:30,720
But he insisted on keeping it.

112
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,660
He said if I get impulsive again, he will remind me of this with it.

113
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:39,100
Now I get impulsive again, but he is gone.

114
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,469
General Leng valued him a lot during the past year.

115
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,459
Last year, the Vice Military Commissioner stepped down due to illness.

116
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,139
Zhao Jie should have been promoted by seniority.

117
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,839
But Hou Bin got promoted in the end.

118
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,869
And I found out it was he who sent those people out to buy herbs.

119
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,909
Also, it was he who took the bandits in.

120
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:03,930
So I started to suspect him.

121
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,519
Before General Hou died...

122
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:13,239
My child... My child...!

123
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:17,550
He seemed to be saying something about his child.

124
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,200
Do you know what that is about?

125
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:26,430
He should be talking about his wife and son.

126
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,010
About three or four years ago, his wife died in childbirth.

127
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,239
He lost his wife and his son.

128
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,149
He and his wife loved each other very much.

129
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,030
It hit him quite hard.

130
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,990
Does it have anything to do with his death?

131
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,460
Maybe it does.

132
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,540
Jinli.

133
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,700
Does General Hou also play with dung beetles?

134
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,829
It's a folk prescription in the Southwest.

135
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,799
Dung beetles in honey with some vinegar.

136
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,029
It's for treating malignant sores.

137
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,579
We use it a lot in the army.

138
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:26,260
Is there anything wrong with it?

139
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,049
General Zhao, there is blood on your hand.

140
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,069
It's fine.

141
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:54,679
I guess I got it from General Zhao when we were standing together.

142
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,139
Prepare some water. I'll take a bath.

143
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,540
Yes.

144
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,310
Your Highness.

145
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,159
The new wound on General Hou's abdomen was the one

146
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,619
that he cut from left to right
[Autopsy Report]

147
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,679
with his right hand holding a knife.

148
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,240
But that wound is different from a normal one.

149
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,119
What's the difference?

150
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,719
Whether it's cut by others or by oneself, that person will feel pain

151
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,029
when his flesh is cut.

152
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,919
And he will dodge when he feels pain.

153
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,439
The wound will vary in depth.

154
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,309
Especially when you cut yourself.

155
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,409
No matter how tough you are,

156
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,439
you will use less strength because of the pain.

157
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,609
The wound is deep when you insert the sword but shallow when you draw it out.

158
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,219
Bur General Hou's wound is different.

159
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,649
There is almost no change in the depth of his wound.

160
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:58,259
As if he couldn't feel pain.

161
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,219
Yes.

162
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,899
Did he do something else after he cut open his abdomen,

163
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,809
as if he was looking for something in his abdomen

164
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:08,449
and trying to take it out?

165
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:11,079
Your Highness, how do you know that?

166
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,139
I couldn't believe it at first.

167
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,199
But I checked it many times.

168
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,759
His viscera are in a mess.

169
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,440
He reached in and pulled them around.

170
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,220
Chu Chu, does General Hou have malignant sores?

171
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,339
Yes. There are many marks of old wounds on his body.

172
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,589
Especially the one that runs through his chest.

173
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,879
It hasn't fully healed.

174
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,759
Looks like he relapsed many times.

175
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,569
There are two malignant sores on his back around the perforated wound.

176
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:41,769
It was treated sloppily.

177
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:46,799
There was a sour smell on the surface with some fine powder.

178
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,670
I guess he used a folk prescription in Qianzhou.

179
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,059
The prescription of dung beetles in honey?

180
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,239
You even know the folk prescription in the Southwest?

181
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,020
You are so good.

182
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,419
It's just my speculation.

183
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,679
Chu Chu, did the three dead soldiers

184
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,979
also have malignant sores on them?

185
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:10,099
I can't tell from the man who burned himself.

186
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,039
But there are malignant sores on the men who were drowned and strangled to death.

187
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,299
Did they also use this prescription?

188
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,739
The drowned soldier was submerged.

189
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,049
I can't tell if he used it.

190
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,559
But the strangled soldier's wound is broken.

191
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,880
Obviously he used it.

192
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,009
Your Highness, what's wrong?

193
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,549
Is there any problem?

194
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,109
No, that's right.

195
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:39,000
I know how they were poisoned.

196
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,759
You'd better stay quiet.

197
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,959
Something happened tonight.

198
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,580
No one has time to take care of you.

199
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,100
You are not like Xiao Jinyu's people at all.

200
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,709
I did it for your own good.

201
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,330
After everything is over, I will release you.

202
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,339
You are a rebel!

203
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,180
You know nothing about it.

204
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,789
Did you see that?

205
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:44,709
My life is coming to an end.

206
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:47,499
What did I go through these troubles for?

207
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:51,449
I did it all for you, for the Leng clan!

208
00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:52,999
Bah!

209
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,100
The Leng clan has been guarding the Southwest for Tang for generations and we are brave and loyal.

210
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,669
If it wasn't for your greed for power,

211
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,830
how would the emperor grant a marriage to me and Xiao Jinli?

212
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:07,560
All these years I've been trying to escape from such a fate.

213
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:13,170
Now you are saying you did it for me and for the Leng clan?

214
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,319
I will never believe you.

215
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,459
The Leng clan will never believe you!

216
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:21,589
You can kill me now, or after I untie the ropes,

217
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:25,049
I will kill you by myself even to be blamed as the black sheep of our family!

218
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:26,829
Fine.

219
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,779
I'll give you what you want!

220
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:31,380
General Leng!

221
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,219
What are you doing?

222
00:14:34,219 --> 00:14:36,209
Your Highness.

223
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,679
- Chu Chu.
- Get up.

224
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,639
This is my family affair.

225
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,269
It's none of your concern.

226
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:48,340
There is no family affair between us.

227
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,170
Commandery Prince An, do you need anything?

228
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,909
I didn't see Leng Yue and I was a little worried.

229
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,249
I was going to see Wu Chen, the secretary

230
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:04,740
in charge of military supplies, and ask him a few questions.

231
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,559
I passed by and vaguely heard Leng Yue's voice.

232
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,260
So I came here to have a look.

233
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,879
Your Highness, I asked him why he concealed his illness from the court.

234
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,709
He knocked me out with his hand and tied me up.

235
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,689
He said he will release me after everything is over.

236
00:15:19,689 --> 00:15:21,290
Your Highness.

237
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,829
General Leng, it's your family affair

238
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:29,469
and it's about your military business, I shouldn't ask too much.

239
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,919
But considering what happened tonight, to avoid misunderstanding,

240
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,659
I want to ask you one question.

241
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:40,410
Did you really not report your illness to the court?

242
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,990
What do you mean?

243
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,350
You may not know that the Minister of War, Feng Jie, was murdered

244
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,720
when he arrived in Chang'an.

245
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,019
There was a special volume of inspection notes missing.

246
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:04,720
What?

247
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,709
After I learned about your condition, I asked Jinli about it

248
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,679
and he remembered that you once talked to Minister Feng alone

249
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,530
for half a day during his inspection.

250
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:25,459
That's right. I did tell my condition to Feng Jie on that day.

251
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:31,149
It concerns the military power in the Southwest

252
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,579
and the future of the Leng family after my death.

253
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:38,829
It also concerns the safety of the Southwest border in Tang.

254
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,120
I know how important it is.

255
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:47,909
I've discussed with Feng Jie that I would keep my condition a secret

256
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,919
so as to stabilize the military spirit

257
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,759
and prevent the bandits from creating a disturbance in the Southwest.

258
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,949
Feng Jie would write down my condition

259
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,449
and present it to His Majesty in person

260
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,829
to come up with a good solution.

261
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:08,540
I didn't know Feng Jie died so suddenly as he arrived in Chang'an.

262
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,799
I didn't receive any imperial edict.

263
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,859
I thought His Majesty would appoint a new Minister of War

264
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:21,859
and that's why Xue Rucheng came to Qianzhou.

265
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:25,929
But he didn't set foot in my camp.

266
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,930
He just returned to Chang'an like that.

267
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,259
So there were several mysterious deaths in the camp

268
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:35,629
when I asked Leng Yue to send you a letter and greet you.

269
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,239
It was such a coincidence.

270
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,480
No wonder you got suspicious.

271
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,799
Then you sent me a letter and invited me to investigate the case

272
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,229
to find out if I was up to other things

273
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,890
and to make sure Leng Yue was safe. Right?

274
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:02,359
You want me to find out the fact, but you don't trust me that much.

275
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,839
So you are not going to tell me the truth.

276
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,559
But Leng Yue acted impulsively and had a fight with you.

277
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,799
You had no choice but to keep her in your barracks

278
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,739
to keep her safe after everything becomes clear.

279
00:18:16,739 --> 00:18:18,129
Am I right?

280
00:18:18,129 --> 00:18:22,120
You are smart indeed.

281
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,779
General Leng, is the moxa stick yours?

282
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,380
Yes.

283
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,599
I had rheumatism once.

284
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,699
Nothing worked.

285
00:18:38,699 --> 00:18:45,189
The doctor asked me to burn a moxa stick and keep using it.

286
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,379
Although rheumatism can't be totally cured,

287
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,749
at least it can alleviate the pain.

288
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,709
Your Highness, there is something wrong with the moxie.

289
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,879
- What's wrong?
- This moxa is a little darker than the normal moxa.

290
00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:58,989
And there is a strange smell.

291
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,690
Let me take a look.

292
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,340
- There is cinnabar in it.
- Cinnabar?

293
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,439
This moxa is mixed with cinnabar.

294
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,259
The burning cinnabar is poisonous.

295
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:29,869
It's hard to be noticed while being mixed in the moxa.

296
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,699
Grandpa, there is a reason that you became ill.

297
00:19:32,699 --> 00:19:34,760
It's because of the moxa.

298
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,199
Where did you get the moxa?

299
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,900
Wu Chen.

300
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,789
It's still warm. He just left.

301
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,329
- Soldiers.
- Yes.

302
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:57,599
Pass down my order. Guard all the entrances and the exits.

303
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,909
Search every corner of the camp. You must find Wu Chen out.

304
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,270
Yes.

305
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,749
General Leng, are you sure that Wu Chen gave the moxa to you?

306
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,699
Yes.

307
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,029
Are you looking for the evidence that he tried to kill me?

308
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,549
I'm here to find the evidence that he poisoned the soldiers.

309
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,580
He poisoned the soldiers?

310
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:25,759
Did he kill Hou Bin?

311
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,439
I'm afraid he is responsible for the recent events in the army.

312
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,169
What a bold bastard!

313
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,199
If I get him, I will skin him alive.

314
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,119
Jinyu.

315
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,269
I've found it out.

316
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,439
Feng Li who strangled himself has someone in his family who also hanged himself.

317
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,599
Wang Chi, who drowned himself, had some relatives who drowned

318
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,399
in a flood in his hometown.

319
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,899
And General Xu who rushed into the fire, his old house caught fire

320
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,929
and his mother died in theflames.

321
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,199
The three of them are just like General Hou.

322
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,039
They were away from home when something happened to their loved ones.

323
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,500
They had been feeling guilty.

324
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,980
Your Highness, this was found in the ashes of the incense burner.

325
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,260
Show it to me.

326
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:18,790
Your Highness, this is the powder made from the seeds of datura flower.

327
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:24,959
General Leng, this is what makes the soldiers in the camp go crazy for no reason.

328
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:27,499
Wu Chen used it as a drug enhancer

329
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:29,649
which can make the victims see illusions.

330
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,479
These illusions are associated with

331
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,829
the long-suppressed painful experiences of the victims.

332
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:37,389
As long as the murderer knows enough about these people's experiences,

333
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,319
he can guess what kind of illusions

334
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,339
they will see when the poison starts to work.

335
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:43,029
Then he can design the way they kill themselves.

336
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:46,979
How did he do it?

337
00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:51,719
I thought at first that maybe someone used poison.

338
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,739
We used a lot of methods

339
00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:57,109
to ensure the safety of food and drinking water in the army.

340
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,810
Where else could he put the poison in?

341
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,029
He mixed the datura flower powder

342
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,519
in the medicine for treating malignant sores.

343
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:07,460
[Sterculia lychnophora]

344
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:23,310
Those who have malignant sores will be poisoned when they apply it.

345
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,339
Commandery Prince An and I have checked it.

346
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:31,859
All the soldiers who have gone crazy all had malignant sores

347
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:35,159
and they all used the same prescription to treat the malignant sore.

348
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,760
But Jing...

349
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,609
But Dog doesn't have any malignant sores.

350
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,380
How did he get poisoned?

351
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,639
He doesn't have malignant sores.

352
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,639
But he touched the most critical ingredient for treating malignant sores.

353
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:49,979
What?

354
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,809
The living dung beetles raised in the infirmary.

355
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,610
Dung beetles?

356
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,339
Chu Chu and I have checked the infirmary.

357
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,979
I think Wu Chen mixed the datura powder

358
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,240
into the baked dung beetle powder when he counted the medicinal supplies.

359
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,159
Because the jar of dung beetle powder

360
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,959
was next to the jar of living dung beetles,

361
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,979
some powder floated into the jar of the living dung beetles.

362
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,999
Dog accidentally got some powder on his hand

363
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,579
during the dung beetle race with the wounded soldiers without knowing it.

364
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:25,259
I guess he got excited and then he just took the water and drank it.

365
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,409
That's how he got poisoned.

366
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,829
The seeds of the datura flower are hard to get.

367
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:32,859
There are tight restrictions on entering and leaving the camp.

368
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,129
I asked Jinli to check the records.

369
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,789
The only person who touched the jar of dung beetle powder

370
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:40,809
and is able to bring the datura flower powder back to the camp

371
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:44,040
is Wu Chen in charge of military supplies.

372
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,620
Your Highness, please check this out.

373
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,420
Your Highness, this is the kind of moxa used by my grandpa.

374
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:06,409
The moxa should be brought here in a whole box.

375
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,859
The moxa sticks in General Leng's barracks

376
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,219
can only cover three or four days.

377
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,159
Yes.

378
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,769
These moxa sticks are not enough to replenish a whole box.

379
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:21,149
According to Jinli, those who left to buy supplies won't be back in ten days,

380
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,600
which means Wu Chen didn't plan to keep poisoning you.

381
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:33,400
Did he stop because he knew we were coming here?

382
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,430
No.

383
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:44,449
General Leng, I was taking a bath in my barracks.

384
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,399
Sorry, I'm late.

385
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:48,809
Take your men to search for Wu Chen.

386
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:52,499
You must find him out before dawn.

387
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,339
Search for Wu Chen? What's wrong?

388
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,539
- Hurry up!
- Yes.

389
00:24:55,539 --> 00:24:57,319
Hold on.

390
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,349
General Zhao, please remind the soldiers

391
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,809
that he might dress up as a soldier and blend in the search team.

392
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,410
Got it.

393
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,189
All these soldiers can't even find a civil official.

394
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,550
Can he fly or go under the ground?

395
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:27,279
General Leng, one night has passed.

396
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,929
I think they have searched all the places in the camp

397
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,260
where he can hide himself.

398
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:39,499
General Leng, please order your men to pay attention to the places

399
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,579
where only the dead can stay.

400
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,440
You mean...

401
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,280
Wu Chen is dead?

402
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:54,409
If he hasn't escaped from the army and he isn't among the soldiers,

403
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,710
then there is only one possibility left.

404
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,379
General Leng. Commandery Prince An.

405
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,380
We have found Wu Chen.

406
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,419
General Leng. Commandery Prince An.

407
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,629
These two cooks found Wu Chen's body in the well

408
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:21,380
when they went to draw water this morning.

409
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,529
Has anyone been here before?

410
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,579
I have asked them.

411
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,459
They were searching all night.

412
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,739
Countless people passed here.

413
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,560
The footprints are messy.

414
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,179
The bottoms of their shoes are the same. We can't tell anything.

415
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,409
The deceased male is over 30.

416
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,929
His mouth and eyes are slightly open. There is a swelling on his abdomen.

417
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,570
There are bruises caused by struggling.

418
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,909
There is foam in his nose and mouth.

419
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:50,299
He was drowned.
[Nasal cavity Oral cavity]

420
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:52,649
But his body has been soaked in water,

421
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,929
it's hard to determine the exact time of his death.

422
00:26:54,930 --> 00:27:00,859
I assume he died between 1:00 and 5:00 a.m.

423
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,560
Between 1:00 and 5:00?

424
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,459
That's when Hou Bin died and we were searching for him.

425
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,769
Could he have jumped into the well in desperation

426
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:12,889
when we were looking for him?

427
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,789
He might have been holding this rope and hiding in the well.

428
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,579
He didn't expect that we would search for him all night.

429
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,100
He lost his strength gradually, so he fell into the well and drowned.

430
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:24,499
This place is not close to the three entrances and exits of the camp.

431
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,239
And it's not on the way from his barracks to the exit.

432
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,550
Even when he was fleeing from us, he shouldn't hide here.

433
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:38,430
Are you suspecting that Wu Chen was murdered?

434
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:45,000
Chu Chu, perform a thorough autopsy on him.

435
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,859
Go ahead and do what you need to do. I'll sign the approval paper for you.

436
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,009
Okay.

437
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:51,909
But, Your Highness, I need something first.

438
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:54,879
Miss Chu, just tell us what you need.

439
00:27:54,879 --> 00:27:58,629
As long as we have it, we will give it to you.

440
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,349
Thank you, General Leng.

441
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:05,829
I need green onion, pepper, salt, white plum, lees (deposits of dead yeast or residual yeast), vinegar,

442
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,929
one garlic mortar, and two mats.

443
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:11,929
Please find an open space in the camp for me.

444
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:16,769
I need to dig a two-meter pit and burn some firewood in the pit.

445
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,619
Are you going to cook?

446
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,129
I want to braise him.

447
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,429
Chu Chu, are you going to eat him?

448
00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:25,679
No, no.

449
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,749
I'm not going to eat him.

450
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,200
Braising him with my method

451
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,320
can let us know if he jumped into the well by himself.

452
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,619
General Leng, Chu Chu is from a family of coroners.

453
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,129
She often uses some unusual but really useful methods.

454
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,970
I think you should let her try it.

455
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,979
- Cooks.
- Yes!

456
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:53,629
Bring the stuff Miss Chu needs.

457
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,379
Yes.

458
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,609
Thank you, General Leng.

459
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,369
Zhao Jie. Jinli.

460
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,409
Yes.

461
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,389
Do whatever Miss Chu says.

462
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:02,790
Yes.

463
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,739
Leng Yue, stay here and help Chu Chu.

464
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,699
Okay.

465
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,789
Commandery Prince An, can we talk in your room?

466
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,979
General Leng, please.

467
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,480
Please.

468
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,139
[Jiangshan Hall]

469
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,219
You've read the memorial of Commandery Prince An.

470
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,779
The Prefect of Qianzhou, Li Zhang, has been brought to justice.

471
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,300
But Commandery Prince An thinks

472
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,199
Li Zhang is not the main culprit behind the illegal minting of coins.

473
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:41,299
What do you think?
[Memorial]

474
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:44,169
I think what Commandery Prince An said is reasonable.

475
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:45,669
Minister Wang,

476
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:48,389
what Commandery Prince An wrote in the memorial,

477
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,089
except for the arrest of Li Zhang,

478
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:54,219
the evidence of the rest of the events has all been destroyed.

479
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,919
It can just be his side of the story.

480
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,020
How is it reasonable?

481
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,950
Your Majesty, I think Commandery Prince An is putting himself off and fooling you.

482
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,979
Now he has gone to the camp of the Military Commissioner of Qianzhou

483
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,049
in the name of investigating the case.

484
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:14,500
He is meddling in military affairs and acting beyond his authority.

485
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:20,709
Minister Han, when I went to the Southwest,

486
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:24,379
Commandery Prince An mentioned this case to me.

487
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:28,099
The case of illegal minting of coins is really complicated.

488
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,289
It's understandable that Commandery Prince An

489
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,510
couldn't make it clear for the moment.

490
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,980
Minister Xue, you two are really interesting.

491
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,219
You are his teacher and the head of the Ministry of War.

492
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,319
You were ordered to go to the Southwest to inspect military affairs.

493
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,419
You found out nothing about the military affairs.

494
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,089
But now you are meddling in the affairs of the Three Judicial Offices.

495
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,459
Commandery Prince An is the head of the Three Judicial Offices.

496
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,159
There is no end to his investigation of the illegal minting of coins.

497
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,069
Now he is meddling in the military affairs of the Southwest.

498
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,959
The both of you acted beyond your authority.

499
00:30:57,959 --> 00:31:00,859
Does Commandery Prince An have a bad influence on his noble teacher

500
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,880
or did you mislead your clever student?

501
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,529
Commandery Prince An only mentioned a few words about the illegal minting when we were chatting.

502
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:14,299
As for why he went to General Leng's army,

503
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,689
I believe he will give us an explanation.

504
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:20,439
General Leng has always ruled his army rigorously.

505
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:24,280
He won't let others lay a hand on military affairs that easily.

506
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,880
You are so interested in the affairs of the Three Judicial Offices,

507
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,509
then you should bring back the rebels who survived.

508
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:37,819
But you didn't bring back the person you should bring back,

509
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,289
you even lost the person you shouldn't bring back.

510
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,909
Commandery Prince An was ordered to investigate the illegal minting case.

511
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:47,679
Now it turns out like this.

512
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,670
Shouldn't he thank his teacher for that?

513
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:55,529
The illegal minting of coins has always been a major case.

514
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:58,129
Commandery Prince An has the right to act at his discretion,

515
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,979
but he went to the Southwest this time to look for his father.

516
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,129
He didn't take much luggage and many attendants.

517
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,420
Maybe he just needs some help.

518
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,059
Ask the Military Commissioner for help?

519
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,049
What does he want to do?

520
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:12,109
The Commandery Prince entered the camp of the Military Commissioner in private.

521
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:17,099
Minister Xue, you've taught a wonderful student.

522
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,489
Minister Xue is the teacher of Commandery Prince An.

523
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:23,699
It's normal that they mentioned a few words about official business

524
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,059
when they were chatting.

525
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:31,619
But what Minister Han said is true.

526
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,289
There is no solid evidence in the memorial.

527
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:36,639
No matter what, Li Zhang is still a prefect of a state.

528
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,099
Even he wants to arrest him, he should have irrefutable proof.

529
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,299
Right now, Commandery Prince An couldn't find out the truth.

530
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,390
So he claimed that there is someone else behind Li Zhang.

531
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:50,780
He is smart indeed.

532
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:55,810
Minister Xue, am I right?

533
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,309
Your Majesty.

534
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:05,839
Commandery Prince An failed in his task, made decisions without authorization,

535
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,299
deceived his superior and subordinates, intervened in military affairs, and acted beyond his authority.

536
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:12,600
He should be brought back to Chang'an and be punished.

537
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,339
Minister Jing, what do you think?

538
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:23,529
I think there is another possibility that's why

539
00:33:23,529 --> 00:33:26,530
Commandery Prince An only mentioned his speculation

540
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:28,499
but not any solid evidence.

541
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,589
It's not because there is no real evidence.

542
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:34,339
Commandery Prince An worries that some treacherous men

543
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:38,160
might take the letter away and cause unnecessary troubles.

544
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:43,159
Commandery Prince An has always been thoughtful and cautious.

545
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,289
Your Majesty, I think you can order him to come back first.

546
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,369
After Commandery Prince An returns to Chang'an,

547
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,189
if there is no real evidence

548
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,659
to prove his speculation in this memorial,

549
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,509
you can punish him at that time.

550
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:59,479
Yes, Senior Jing has a point.

551
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,889
Your Majesty, I think what Senior Jing said is reasonable.

552
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,829
If you are going to punish Commandery Prince An,

553
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,960
you should punish him after he returns to Chang'an.

554
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:13,020
Your Majesty, I also agree with what Senior Jing said.

555
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,749
All right, let me think about it.

556
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,450
You can leave now.

557
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,820
Yes, Your Majesty.
