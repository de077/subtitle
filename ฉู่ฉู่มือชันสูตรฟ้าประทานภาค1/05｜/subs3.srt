Things are odd with Minister Feng's death.

The two corpses His Highness dug up from the graves

4
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:18,310
are also related to Minister Feng's death.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,629
He somehow found the connections between the three cases,

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,069
which seemed irrelevant at first sight.

His Highness is the best judge I've ever seen.

I'll definitely help him find out Minister Feng's real cause of death.

I didn't expect you to be so vile.

What's going on?

106
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,860
Commandery Prince An,

107
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,150
I heard that His Majesty has given you a verbal order,

108
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,280
forbidding you from disturbing Feng Manor.

109
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,350
You even disobey His Majesty now?

110
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,629
Madam Feng, I happened to hear your conversation.

111
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,500
There might be a misunderstanding.

112
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,790
Misunderstanding?

113
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,999
That's a coroner.

114
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:35,299
Commandery Prince An came here in the middle of the night with a coroner.

115
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:37,189
And he set the mourning hall on fire.

116
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,880
That's a misunderstanding?

117
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,389
I think he's disregarding the emperor's order and revenging his personal grudges.

118
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:45,039
He's such a disloyal and heartless person.

119
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,199
How can he properly manage Three Judicial Chief Ministries?

120
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,149
Commandery Prince An, I'll definitely unite ministers of Three Judicial Chief Ministries

121
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:54,530
and report what happened today to His Majesty for his judgment.

122
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,389
Lord Han. Madam Feng.

123
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,339
Commandery Prince An is a student of mine.

124
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,359
I know his characters.

125
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:03,579
He's definitely not a vile person.

126
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,049
Please give him a chance to explain today's incident.

127
00:07:06,049 --> 00:07:08,180
If he can't convince you,

128
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,169
Lord Han and I can bring him to see His Majesty in person.

129
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:12,979
Madam, how do you think of that?

130
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:14,920
What does he have to say?

131
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,509
Nothing.

132
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,909
I didn't do this.

133
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,039
However, I don't have evidence to prove my innocence right now.

134
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,199
I can only provide it when I catch the real culprit.

135
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:26,399
By then, if Madam Feng wants to take me to His Majesty,

136
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,140
I'll cooperate.

137
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,390
Madam Feng, I have a thing to show you now.

138
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,790
Give me your hands.

139
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,640
Show your hands.

140
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,869
She was trapped in flames.

141
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:45,730
To save Minister Feng's remains from the fire, she was willing to sacrifice her life.

142
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,710
These are the bruises left by dragging.

143
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,189
If she hadn't guarded the remains with her life,

144
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,909
they would've become ashes in the flames.

145
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,469
Whoever the arsonist is, this incident has nothing to do with her.

146
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,610
You mustn't humiliate her like this.

147
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,320
- Your Highness.
- Shut up.

148
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,539
Madam. Forget it.

149
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,789
It's late into the night.

150
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,909
If we disturb the neighbors and allow them to know the incident,

151
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:08,379
Master's reputation will be stained.

152
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,980
It's better that we let Master rest in peace sooner.

153
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,219
Madam. I found this in the mourning hall.

154
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:17,229
I don't know what it is.

155
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,210
It was found next to Master's coffin.

156
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,399
It must have fallen from the top of the house because of the fire.

157
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,599
Don't make a fuss before the lords.

158
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,180
Madam Feng, are there any other matters you wish me to elaborate on?

159
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,710
Lord Han, Madam Feng is a housewife.

160
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,979
It's natural that she panics and jumps to conclusions based on preliminary pieces of evidence before incidents.

161
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,899
But you're the Minister of Justice.

162
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,899
You're an expert of observing and judging cases.

163
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,490
You speak recklessly without research and interrogation.

164
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,799
Even if you don't criticize me before His Majesty, I'll criticize you.

165
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,650
Okay. Go ahead.

166
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,890
What?

167
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,299
It's tilted.

168
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,489
What's tilted?

169
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:02,560
Your bun is tilted.

170
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,490
It was struck by the sedan.

171
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,750
It's still tilted.

172
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,610
Move away. Where are they?

173
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,690
This...

174
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,100
Commandery Prince An!

175
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,319

00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,100
You'll get me killed one day.

00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,130

- Eunuch Sun.

179
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,590
Master! Bad news.

180
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,960
Zhou Han failed again.

181
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,400
Failed again?

182
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,029
He almost succeeded.

183
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:53,030
That female coroner was almost burned to death in the mourning hall.

184
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,740
What?

185
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,950
Zhou Han! That good-for-nothing!

186
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:03,490
Who asked him to kill the female coroner?

187
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,120
He can't get things done but can make things worse.

188
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,250
Wait.

189
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,659
You just said that

190
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,760
Xiao Jinyu brought that female coroner to Feng Manor again?

191
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,949
He insisted on apologizing to Madam Feng.

192
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:22,290
Who will apologize to a widow in the middle of a night?

193
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,189
He was not there to apologize.

194
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,000
He was there to inspect the corpse.

195
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,360
We're in trouble this time.

196
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,310
Come closer.

197
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,969
Well. What can he find?

198
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:43,289
- Hurry! Go!
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

199
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:45,950
Master, don't be mad. Ease your angry.

200
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:05,150
Miss Chu. Miss Chu.

201
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,840
Your Higness, it's Miss Lian Qiao.

202
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,150
Lian Qiao.

203
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,659
See if the kitchen has prepared spirit-calming decoction.

204
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,060
Yes.

205
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,200
You must be frightened.

206
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,879
I'm not scared.

207
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,000
I just...

208
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,170
I lost all my tools.

209
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,660
I'm sorry. I was late.

210
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,439
No. No. It's not your fault.

211
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:53,460
I was so careless that I didn't notice my tools were missing.

212
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,709
Thankfully, those tools were destroyed by the fire.

213
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,269
They can't tell what they are.

214
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:01,710
Otherwise, I would have got you in big trouble again.

215
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,360
It's fine.

216
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,450
I made those tools myself.

217
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,779
I can make another set.

218
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:11,050
It's just that

219
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,450
I'm feeling a bit sad

220
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,559
because those tools are like old friends to me

221
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,979
since they've been with me for a long time.

222
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,510
I'll be fine soon.

223
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,879
In the previous situation,

224
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,509
it's awkward for you to ask for the return of the tools.

225
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,309
If you really want them, I can order someone to retrieve them later.

226
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,030
Thank you, Your Highness.

227
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,859
You were the closest to the mourning hall when it caught fire.

228
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,619
Do you know how the fire was started?

229
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,659
I don't know.

230
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,339
I was too busy with the autopsy.

231
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,779
I only found the house on fire when I finished the autopsy.

232
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,149
You locked the doors and windows of the mourning hall?

233
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,659
No, I only shut the door.

234
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,300
But I don't know why I couldn't open it.

235
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,829
Your Highness, the fire was so fierce.

236
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,779
Why did you run into it?

237
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,550
Aren't you afraid of death?

238
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,000
I am.

239
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,179
Then, why did you do that?

240
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,269
I was afraid that you might die.

241
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,029
You were afraid that I might die?

242
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,510
I...

243
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,989
I'm afraid, because if you die,

244
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,189
I'll stay up all night to write reports and archive the cases.

245
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,590
Remember, whenever and wherever

246
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,299
if you're in a situation like this again,

247
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,029
you must do everything to keep yourself alive first.

248
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,659
The consequences of having a corpse destroyed by fire

249
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,799
and having a living person killed by fire

250
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:25,080
are totally different for the ministries and for me.

251
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,029
But there were guards.

252
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,329
If you were worried about me, you didn't have to rush in yourself.

253
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,240
If only Wu Jiang and the other guards went in,

254
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,569
would you flee or would you guard the corpse with them?

255
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,039
Of course, I'd protect the corpse.

256
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,219
So that's the reason

257
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,570
I had to rush in and bring you out.

258
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,299
I know the deceased is as important as the living ones to you.

259
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,379
You're willing to sacrifice your life to make sure their remains are intact.

260
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,609
But, to me, I was the one who sent you to inspect the corpse.

261
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,810
I must ensure your safety.

262
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,850
Your Highness, you're such a nice person.

263
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,020
Try these grapes.

264
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,950
They're from the Western Regions.

265
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,880
Grape skin is bitter.

266
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,980
This is how you eat it.

267
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,980
[Three Judicial Chief Ministries]

268
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,729
You've inspected Feng Jie's remains.

269
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,980
What did you find?

270
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:53,120
I knew their cause of death.

271
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,749
I carefully inspected the wounds on Minister Feng's head.

272
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,360
The wound on his left brow bone was caused by a punch of the fist.

273
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,960
That punch caused the right side of the back of his head to crash into a smooth but hard object,

274
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,899
resulting in small fractures on his skull.

275
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,899
This is the same with the other two victims.

276
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,270
I'm now certain that they were all killed by a similar punch.

277
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,339
But according to people from Feng Manor,

278
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,589
Feng Jie was hurt in the tavern.

279
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,619
If this punch was lethal,

280
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,219
he wouldn't be able to walk back to the manor.

281
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,290
Besides, you've said that these little fractures are not fatal.

282
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,060
Let me put it this way.

283
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,419
There was a staircase where he was wounded.

284
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:37,300
You're right.

285
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,519
The killer chose to carry out the murder on a staircase

286
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,059
because it's convenient to adjust their height difference

287
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,440
so as to make sure the punch

288
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,730
land on Minister Feng's eye socket and below his bow bone.

289
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,009
[On the eye socket Below the bow bone]

290
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,490
[The punched position]

291
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,829
The back of Minister Feng's head hit a hard object that was protruded,

292
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,769
thus causing a small fracture.

293
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,449
[A blow on the back of his head]

294
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,099
[A small fracture]

295
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,209
This wound wasn't instantly fatal.

296
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,579
It didn't even inflict much pain.

297
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,890
So Minister Feng thought it wasn't a big deal.

298
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,240
He didn't take it seriously.

299
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,600
What's his problem?

300
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,269
But this small fracture

301
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,550
would gradually cause blood clots in his brain.

302
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:25,170
Within less than an hour, the clotted blood would make him dizzy.

303
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:28,140
He couldn't talk clearly or walk straight.

304
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,589
That's the thing you said that was in the brains?

305
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,889
Yes. I've inspected.

306
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:36,589
The wounds on the other two victims were the same.

307
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,859
But they've died for quite a while ago.

308
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,779
I won't have an accurate inspection

309
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,029
even if I cut open their skulls now.

310
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,229
Cut open their skulls?

311
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,269
You cut Feng Jie's skull open?

312
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,319
Yes.

313
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:49,629
How could I know whether he has blood clots in his brains or not if I hadn't cut open his skulls?

314
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:50,829
I've inspected carefully.

315
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,539
There were indeed blood clots in his brain.

316
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,119
Moreover, he took strong erectile medications

317
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,739
which caused his blood to flood his brain, worsening his wounds.

318
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,299
Then he died instantly.

319
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,509
But I just saw that Feng Jie's corpse is intact.

320
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:04,199
Of course, it is.

321
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,260
I stitched it back after the autopsy.

322
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,659
You stitched it back up after opening it?

323
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,060
Yes.

324
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,429
It's the same with the way the officers search the crime scenes.

325
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,009
They open doors when they go in.

326
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:22,080
But they have to close the doors when they leave.

327
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,459
That's why you asked for a wig before you left.

328
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,139
You made it into the shape of Feng Jie's bun because you wanted to

329
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,180
restore it to its original shape after your autopsy?

330
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,429
Our skin, hair, and body are given to us by our parents.

331
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,600
It's disrespectful to harm them.

332
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,359
So, you're not ignorant of that.

333
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,199
Do you know that coroners from capital's offices

334
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,659
need permits mandated by the cases' chief officers in order to perform an autopsy.

335
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:50,330
Those who perform autopsies without permits will be charged.

336
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,660
There's such a rule?

337
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,749
But I've already mended the corpse.

338
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,170
I put clothes back on. It's like I've never performed the autopsy.

339
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:01,190
In that case, will I still be charged?

340
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,969
I've never met such a lawbreaking coroner like you.

341
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,139
How to punish you? I have to think carefully.

342
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,459
I didn't break the rules.

343
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,389
I complied with the rules of the Judicial Service.

344
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,779
The rules of the Judicial Service?

345
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,389
Handsome Judge once said that the Judicial Service

346
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,959
shouldn't be restricted by doctrines when handling cases.

347
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,669
Any method is acceptable as long as it leads to the truth.

348
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,579
But we mustn't commit crimes in order to solve cases.

349
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,749
We mustn't ruin the remains in order to inspect them.

350
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,770
So, the Judicial Service's coroners

351
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,459
are allowed to conduct autopsy so long as they can restore the corpses to their initial shapes.

352
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:34,609
You don't know this?

353
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:36,190
I know.

354
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,550
Really? You really do?

355
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,880
- Then, are you...?
- Am I Handsome Judge?

356
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,290
Are you?

357
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,810
Why are you looking for Handsome Judge?

358
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,980
Is it because of your pendant?

359
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,080
Why does he care about the pendant so much?

360
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,490
So, has the person who gave you the pendant told you that

361
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,910
the pendant might belong to Handsome Judge?

362
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,059
Lord Jing, why are you here?

363
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,270
I've been busy all night.

364
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,010
Have you found the arsonist?

365
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,390
Your Highness,

366
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,950
can't you just pretend you don't know and praise me a little bit?

367
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,009
Stop beating around the bushes.

368
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,059
There were five of them.

369
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,579
They all wore masks and black clothes. They're all skilled fighters.

370
00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:39,479
I followed them and saw them disappear into the battalion of Shen Army.

371
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,280
It's Qin Luan again.

372
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,449
Go to meet Han Ji when you're done eating.

373
00:19:46,449 --> 00:19:47,859
Han Ji?

374
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,240
Your Highness, it's so late that even cats are sleeping.

375
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,509
What do I visit that old crow for?

376
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,309
According to people from Feng Manor,

377
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:57,029
it was Han Ji who sent Feng Jie home last night.

378
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,169
So, Han Ji was one of the people who threw the reception banquet for Feng Jie.

379
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,569
If we can find out which tavern Feng Jie was at on that night,

380
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:06,289
it won't be hard to find the real murderer.

381
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,309
Wait. What does it have to do with the tavern?

382
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:12,039
Chu Chu just found out the cause of death of the three victims, including Feng Jie.

383
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:14,179
They were hit at the bow bones and the eye sockets,

384
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,860
causing back skull fractures.

385
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,339
The wounds of the three victims are in the exactly same positions.

386
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,969
It means that the murderer is a trained killer.

387
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,209
So he can kill with just one strike.

388
00:20:23,209 --> 00:20:27,449
As for drinking, it's the key element to conceal his killing method.

389
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:29,120
Drinking?

390
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:33,689
Chu Chu, you just said that the victims would gradually become dizzy

391
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,909
after they were hit in the face

392
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,899
and the skulls were rammed into the wall.

393
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,299
They couldn't speak clearly or walk steadily as if they were drunk.

394
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,599
Yes, that's it.

395
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:44,270
It was just like they were drunk.

396
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,410
Drunk?

397
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:53,089
You mean the murderer used this method

398
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:56,209
so the victims could walk out of the tavern alive

399
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,530
in front of the crowd.

400
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,379
That means someone murdered Minister of War

401
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,789
in front of Minister of Justice without him knowing it.

402
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,909
That's right.

403
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,280
To accomplish this crime,

404
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,509
the killer has to make sure that the victim was drinking when he was injured.

405
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:14,560
It's even better if the victim kept on drinking after the injury.

406
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,089
So, there must be someone facilitating the killer from within the tavern.

407
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:20,440
Karma is real.

408
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,210
Han Ji's got his turn now.

409
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,559
This old crow. He told on me many times before my dad.

410
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,190
He also criticized you many times before His Majesty.

411
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,440
When I see him this time,

412
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,739
- I'll definitely—
- You must keep your mouth shut!

413
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:34,809
When you see Han Ji tonight,

414
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:36,509
you should only find out the whereabouts of the tavern.

415
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:40,309
Once you find that out, pretend you're pursuing a wanted suspect and search the tavern.

416
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:41,929
Don't tell Han Ji anything more than that.

417
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:44,389
Don't leak any information

418
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:47,430
before all the facts of this case come to light.

419
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,970
Tavern?

420
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,219
Your Highness, if you're right,

421
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,629
the last meal Minister Feng had before his death

422
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,749
might be at that tavern.

423
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,859
What?

424
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,789
When I was performing the autopsy on Minister Feng's remains,

425
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,130
I found in his teeth gaps the roots of fish mints.

426
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,219
Judging from the degree of decay,

427
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,700
they might be left from the last meal he had.

428
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,650
Rugui Tavern.

429
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,330
The weather is dry. Things are flammable.

430
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,470
Beware of the flames.

431
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,920
The killer dared to commit the murder in plain sight.

432
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,220
Rugui Tavern must have something to do with it.

433
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,090
Go!
[Rugui Tavern]

434
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,960
Commandery Prince An. Vice Minister Jing.

435
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,509
Such rare guests.

436
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,839
How come? We just came here this morning.

437
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,559
By the order of Commandery Prince An, from Three Judicial Chief Ministries,

438
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,059
we're here to search for the wanted criminals.

439
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,969
Where is your Manager Xu? We have some words for him.

440
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:35,060
I'll find him for you.

441
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,590
This is indeed where the killer committed the crime.

442
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,560
Wait.

443
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,180
What's that place?

444
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,930
That's the kitchen.

445
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,009
It's so late.

446
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:02,390
Who are you cooking for?

447
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,379
We're not cooking.

448
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,749
Our manager wants to take a bath after auditing the accounts.

449
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,030
I'm heating up water for his bath.

450
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,089
Look. Manger's lights are still on.

451
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,050
He must be still awake.

452
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,790
Wu Jiang.

453
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,290
You two. Follow me.

454
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,620
Yes.

455
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,739
Manager, Commandery Prince An is here.

456
00:24:29,739 --> 00:24:31,650
- Chen Feng.
- They say...

457
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,939
Your Highness, we found nothing suspicious.

458
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,349
Your Highness, we neither.

459
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:48,789
It's so weird. Where is Manager Xu?

460
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,109
Who are you asking? We haven't asked you yet?

461
00:24:51,109 --> 00:24:52,329
Where is your manager?

462
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:53,929
He was in the room previously.

463
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:55,159
It's the middle of the night.

464
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:56,689
And the doors are locked from the inside.

465
00:24:56,689 --> 00:24:58,999
I didn't hear him go outside.

466
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:01,509
Xu Rugui might have jumped out of the window and fled

467
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,410
when he heard our movements.

468
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,629
Where is his family?

469
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,389
Our manager doesn't have family members.

470
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,979
He lives here on his own.

471
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,309
I also heard that Xu Rugui has no family.

472
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,219
Although Rugui Tavern is packed with beauties,

473
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,490
he has no romance with any of them.

474
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,099
Is that true?

475
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,899
Vice Minister Jing, you're being too hard on me.

476
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,219
I'm just a small manager who's in charge of a few waitresses.

477
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,610
I know nothing about the manager's personal life.

478
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,179
Rugui Tavern is surrounded by water and is connected to various paths.

479
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,919
It's easy for Xu Rugui to flee when he's startled.

480
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,149
But he can't be perfect when he panics.
[The Map Chonghua Rugui Tavern Huaiyuan]

481
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,550
There must be shreds of evidence in Rugui Tavern.

482
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,539
- Any findings?
- Your Highness, we found nothing suspicious inside.

483
00:25:56,539 --> 00:25:59,159
Pass on my words. Seal Rugui Tavern immediately.

484
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:01,659
We must find Xu Rugui, no matter he's dead or alive.

485
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:03,060
Yes.

486
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,959
It's so late now.

487
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:15,369
Why hasn't our son come back?

488
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:16,939
Why don't you send someone to look for him?

489
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,829
Madam, don't worry. How can I not?

490
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:21,719
We have so many men.

491
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,849
How can we possibly lose his sight in Chang'an?

492
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,589
Okay, my wife.

493
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,819
Don't think too much nonsense.

494
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:33,820
We'll know everything when we wake up tomorrow.

495
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:42,529
Your Highness, you woke me up because you told me there might be a corpse.

496
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:45,260
Are you referring to Manager Xu?

497
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,500
When did your manager ask you to boil water?

498
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,850
About an hour ago.

499
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,540
It took you an hour and the water was still not boiled?

500
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,549
Your Highness, I'm the only one on duty tonight.

501
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,749
I fetched and boiled water all on my own.

502
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,849
It's so tiring.

503
00:27:11,849 --> 00:27:14,369
To do it faster, I started the fire first before

504
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:15,979
I began to fetch water one bucket at a time.

505
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,629
Maybe it was because the firewood was dampened.

506
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,410
It was so hard to start the fire.

507
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:24,559
Xu Rugui must have something to do with the series of homicides that happened here.

508
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,159
The fire at Feng Manor didn't destroy the corpse along with evidence.

509
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,030
Maybe, that's the reason he fled in a hurry.

510
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,109
Answer me.

511
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,139
Did Feng Jie, the Minister of War, drink at this place last night?

512
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,640
Yes.

513
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,129
Along with Minister Han, the Minister of Justice,

514
00:27:37,129 --> 00:27:38,729
and a few other ministers.

515
00:27:38,729 --> 00:27:40,939
Did Minister Feng had an argument with someone?

516
00:27:40,939 --> 00:27:42,600
And he was injured.

517
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,680
That's true.

518
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,859
Then, last month, did Liu Yue, Director of the Ministry of Revenue,

519
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,629
and Lu Chuansheng, Capital Liaison Representative of Qianzhou,

520
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,149
also drink at your place?

521
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,580
He also got in a fight and was injured?

522
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,149
It seems to be true.

523
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:58,349
But having drunk guests causing trouble is inevitable for a tavern.

524
00:27:58,349 --> 00:28:00,119
Why is the kitchen so hot?

525
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,490
It's hotter than the burning house.

526
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:05,889
What? It's not supposed to be so hot when boiling water?

527
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:06,739
No.

528
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,549
My kitchen is smaller than this.

529
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:12,030
But boiling water doesn't make it heat up so badly.

530
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,469
Careful.

531
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,870
Your hands were just injured. This wall is burning.

532
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,079
Burning?

533
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:28,489
This wall is just like that.

534
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:30,389
Maybe it's because the wall was made out of bad materials.

535
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:33,870
When the other side was boiling water, this side will get hot easily.

536
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,890
Commandery Prince An, how is it now?

537
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,360
Yes, it's fine now.

538
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,179
- Wu Jiang.
- Yes.

539
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:51,119
Check it from the outside.

540
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:53,099
See if the chimney is still venting smoke.

541
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,800
Yes.

542
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,749
Your Highness, you sent Wu Jiang on a worthless mission.

543
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,129
The stove is empty.

544
00:28:58,129 --> 00:28:59,760
How can there be any smoke?

545
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,499
Your Highness, it's still venting smoke.

546
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,819
Still?

547
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,399
Hasn't the fire been extinguished? Where does the smoke come from?

548
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,819
Go fetch a bucket of water.

549
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,579
Pour it into the chimney vent.

550
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,639
Remember. Pour the whole bucket inside.

551
00:29:12,639 --> 00:29:13,940
Yes.

552
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,219
Your Highness, I'm pouring now.

553
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,620
Okay.

554
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,880
Why's the sound so big while the stream is so little?

555
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,549
Your Highness, I've poured in the whole bucket.

556
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:54,570
It's all done. Not a drop is left?

557
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,770
Every drop is poured. Not a drop is left.

558
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,459
How's that possible?

559
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,019
The whole bucket has been emptied.

560
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,689
Why is there only a little bit of water on the stove?

561
00:30:01,689 --> 00:30:02,990
What?

562
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,050
The water didn't run into the stove?

563
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,290
Set the fire on again.

564
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:15,159
Wu Jiang, cover the chimney vent.

565
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:16,560
Yes.

566
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,389
Cover the chimney vent?

567
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,299
Your Highness, you're trying to...

568
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:28,629
The wall behind the funnel is hollow.

569
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:31,529
There might be a dark chamber underground where fire can be lit.

570
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,939
The funnel of the dark chamber's stove might be hidden inside this wall.

571
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:39,329
Two tunnels converge in one at the smoke vent of the kitchen's stove.
[The dark chamber]

572
00:30:39,329 --> 00:30:40,909
When it's not used,
[Kitchen The hollow wall]

573
00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:42,449
it's separated by the partition.
[Partition]

574
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,999
When it's used, the partition is removed.

575
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,229
So the smoke can be disguised as the smoke vented by the kitchen's stove.

576
00:30:47,229 --> 00:30:51,090
That's why this wall gets heated up easily.

577
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,909
I see.

578
00:30:52,909 --> 00:30:55,309
It's like catching a rabbit in the mountain.

579
00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:57,079
You set fire on one cave entrance,

580
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,999
then the rabbit comes out from the other entrance.

581
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,239
Your Highness, is that correct?

582
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,640
Sort of.

583
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:08,529
So it means that  Xu Rugui is indeed hidden inside the underground chamber.

584
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:12,210
So, we can just wait for

585
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:17,180
him to come out?

586
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:22,989
Your Highness. There're movements in Xu Rugui's bedroom.

587
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,810
Your Highness.

588
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,860
There's indeed smoke from the rabbit hole.

589
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,360
It seems that here's the dark chamber's entrance.

590
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,869
- Wu Jiang.
- Yes.

591
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:43,909
Go tell those in the kitchen.

592
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:45,269
Order them to distinguish the stove.

593
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:46,670
Yes.

594
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,899
Master, are you asleep?

595
00:31:56,899 --> 00:31:58,289
What is it?

596
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:01,570
Everything's taken care of at Rugui Tavern.

597
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,500
I see.

598
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:22,739
Chu Chu, stay here. Don't wander around.

599
00:32:22,739 --> 00:32:23,999
I want to go with you, Your Highness.

600
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,239
We need you to guard the entrance in case someone blocks it.

601
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,040
Then we'll be in great danger.

602
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,010
I'll do as you say, Your Highness.

603
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,999
- Stay here too.
- Yes.

[Hanbi Hall]

605
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,400
Master.

606
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:48,819
Master, Vice Minister went to search Rugui Tavern with Commandery Prince An.

607
00:32:48,819 --> 00:32:51,329
What? Search Rugui Tavern?

608
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,930
Yes.

609
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,610
- Go and investigate the details.
- Yes, Master.

610
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,119
This is indeed a rabbit hole.

611
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,120
Your Highness, watch out.

612
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,939
Your Highness, what happened?  Your Highness.

613
00:33:18,939 --> 00:33:21,450
Your Highness, what's going on?

614
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,079
You must be too tired.

615
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,079
You worked nonstop without any sleep.

616
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,289
Go back and get some rest.

617
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:31,410
Wu Jiang, investigate it with Jing Yi.

618
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,599
Yes.

619
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,550
Escort His Highness back.

620
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,580
Your Highness, be careful.

621
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,300
Be careful.

622
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,790
Your Highness.

623
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,220
Watch out.

624
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,239
Careful now, Your Highness.

625
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,840
Your Highness,

626
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,579
what's going on?

627
00:33:52,579 --> 00:33:55,510
It's fine. I'm just a bit tired.

628
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,209
- Zhang Yun.
- Yes.

629
00:33:57,209 --> 00:33:58,329
Where's that woman of Rugui Tavern?

630
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,070
She's waiting outside.

631
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,129
You two, go and guard her.

632
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:05,210
Don't let her talk to any people. In case they falsify their testimonies.

633
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,570
Yes.

634
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,450
Thanks.

635
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:31,280
Your Highness, are you afraid of places without windows?

636
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,690
Why did you say so?

637
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:39,939
My brother and I once saved an officer in a mountain cave.

638
00:34:39,939 --> 00:34:42,710
He had the same reactions you have right now.

639
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,649
I heard people say that this is an illness.

640
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,219
Once the patient is in a windowless room, the symptoms attack.

641
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,929
But no one knows how to cure it yet.

642
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:53,790
It's said that there are better and worse episodes too.

643
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,470
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

644
00:34:56,470 --> 00:35:00,619
The officer we saved told us that if we let anyone know this,

645
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:02,210
he'd lose his job.

646
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,929
You're so good at solving cases.

647
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:06,250
I don't want to get you fired.

648
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,470
This is the handkerchief I gave you yesterday.

649
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,220
I've washed it many times. It's clean.

650
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,620
You embroidered this?

651
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,590
If you don't like it...

652
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,050
Your Highness.

653
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,869
Jing Manor has sent someone here.

654
00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:33,759
They say Senior Jing and his madam are worried

655
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,319
because Vice Minister Jing hasn't returned home.

656
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,699
So they sent people to look for him.

657
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,069
They saw that the officers from the Court of Judicial Review are all heading this way.

658
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:41,130
So they came to inquire about it.

659
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:44,929
Tell them. Jing Yi is handling cases with me tonight. He won't go home.

660
00:35:44,929 --> 00:35:46,619
Ask Senior Jing and his madam to rest assured.

661
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,869
Ask them to rest please.

662
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:49,170
