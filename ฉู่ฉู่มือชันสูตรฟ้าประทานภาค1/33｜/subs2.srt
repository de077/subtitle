If it weren't for Chu Chu to find something odd,

I even rushed to the military base.
[Qianzhou]

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,530
I've suspected countless people to be the leader of those rebels.

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,840
But I didn't suspect him.

00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:34,250
How can there be such a stupid judge in Tang?

00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,880
Minister Han,

11
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,739
there are deep strangulation marks on the deceased's neck,

12
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:54,440
from his neck to his ears.

13
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,150
It's for sure that he hanged himself.

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,719
All right, you are done here.

15
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,240
Go to the Ministry of Justice and give your statement.

Guards, takedown the survivor of the rebellious party.

21
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,799
I was wondering where Commandery Prince An got another female coroner.

22
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,219
It's still you.

23
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:26,389
Commandery Prince An has always been fair and upright.

24
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:29,690
But now he deceived the emperor.

25
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,630
I'll take you to the emperor today.

26
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,620
I'd like to see how Commandery Prince An explains it.

27
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,140
Take her down.

28
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:42,090
Minister Han, when did I deceive the emperor?

29
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,120
Commandery Prince An, you came just in time.

30
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,020
Do you dare to say

31
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,839
that this woman is not the survivor of the rebellious party, Chu Chu?

32
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,679
She is Chu Chu.

33
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,750
But she is also a coroner working for me.

34
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,879
Since she is a coroner of the Three Judicial Offices,

35
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,750
is there any problem that she works for me?

36
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,540
Commandery Prince An, don't forget

37
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,039
it's not up to you to decide if she can be a coroner or not.

38
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,639
It requires the certificate jointly issued by

39

00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,689
Your Highness, when did you get the certificate issued by the Ministry of Personnel

53
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:49,710
and the Three Judicial Offices?

54
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,410
That was before the exam.

55
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:56,329
I asked the emperor for a blank identity certificate signed by the Ministry of Personnel

56
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:59,070
and the Three Judicial Offices.

57
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:02,559
It will take effect immediately after I fill in the applicant's information.

00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:04,740
Why didn't you tell me before?

59
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,970
I filled it in last night.

60
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,080
Last night?

61
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,000
I didn't decide to hire you last night.

I haven't filled it in

65
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,040
because I want to give you a chance to regret.

66
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,019
You need to know this is a certificate of the government.

67
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:37,390
Once filled in, it cannot be changed.

68

70
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:46,319
I believe you.

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,200
I believe this is how you really think at this moment.

72
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,600
But I don't know if you will still think in this way in the future.

73

it's a pleasure to work for me.

00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,760

00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,810
You do have a point.

79
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:21,499
But no one said that I have to be your coroner forever.

After an on-site investigation and evidence collection,

100
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,689
it has been verified that he committed suicide.

101
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:48,670
But he was forced.

102
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,769
He gave up his life in a desperate situation

Your Grace, don't you plead guilty?

105
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,290
That's nonsense.

106
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,340
Doctor Zhang and I have no grudges.

107
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,140

Doctor Zhang has been my doctor.

Your Grace, can I have it?

117
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,050
Everyone, please take a look.

118
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,629
This medical record is about Princess Xiping's pregnancy.

119
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:56,289
I've asked the doctors in the Imperial Medical Service to read it.

120
00:10:56,289 --> 00:11:02,799
The signs are that Princess Xiping only bore one child at that time.

121
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,249
- One child?
- Something is going to happen.

122
00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:17,350
Minister Han, during pregnancy, even the pulse can be inaccurate sometimes.

123
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,449
Everyone in Chang'an knows that I gave birth to twins.

124
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:23,540
Now my children have grown up.

125
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,840
You don't believe the facts.

126
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,170
But you want to believe the old medical record.

127
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,999
The fact is you only gave birth to one child.

128
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:36,780
The other child was adopted from somewhere else.

129
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,379
You are talking nonsense.

130
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,209
As a princess of Tang, if I want to adopt a child,

131
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:42,909
I can just get one and raise the child up.

132
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:44,650
Why would I cover it up?

133
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,300
That's because the child you adopted is not from an ordinary family,

134
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:53,060
but the son of Chen Ying, the Military Commissioner who led the rebellion during the time of Emperor Wenzong.

135
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,220
That's nonsense! Nonsense!

136
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,399
If you insist that I'm talking nonsense,

137
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,109
then please hear out the evidence I collected.

138
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:06,739
You are a distinguished princess.

139
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,690
You grew up in the palace.

140
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,990
After you got married with Xiao Heng,

141
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,769
you left the palace and built your own mansion.

142
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,039
The person who could let you make all the efforts to adopt her son

143
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,520
must have a deep friendship with you.

144
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,150
In Chang'an at that time, only the wife of Chen Ying

145
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:27,270
was your good friend who was also pregnant.

146
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,620
According to the dossier,

147
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,770
Madam Chen had been pregnant for nearly eight months.

148
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,499
She got too emotional after hearing the news about Chen Ying

149
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,270
and died of losing too much blood before giving birth.

150
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:41,569
Logically, the bones of the child

151
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:45,990
should be still curled up in Chen's pelvis.

152
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,399
But I sent someone to check the coffin last night.

153
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:52,209
The child's bones are still there.

154
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:56,799
But it's straight and lying between Chen's legs.

155
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,250
Thus it can be seen

156
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,899
that someone put the bones of a dead child later to mislead the people.

157
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:04,980
Am I right?

158
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,400
If you still don't believe what I said,

159
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,630
I can bring up the witnesses.

160
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,270
Bring up the witnesses.

161
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,989
Your Grace, do you still remember these two people?

162
00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:36,890
Raise your head.

163
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:43,739
The elder of these two people was a wet nurse in your mansion back then.

164
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:47,630
The other was your former maid.

165
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,539
In order to conceal that she adopted a child,

166
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,159
Princess Xiping sent the maids

167
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:56,929
and servants who knew the fact out of the mansion

168
00:13:56,929 --> 00:13:58,720
and settled them down in Yangzhou.

169
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,420
But you also left yourself a way out.

170
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:06,209
You detained their family in your mansion as hostages.

171
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:10,190
These two people's sister and son

172
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,999
were detained in your mansion.

173
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,619
After so many years, they missed their family too much.

174
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,439
They saw your two sons had grown up,

175
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:21,129
so they want to take their family back.

176
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,819
They didn't expect that they would be rejected

177
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:27,380
and nearly assassinated.

178
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,630
I didn't do it.

179
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,459
They voluntarily left the kids in my mansion.

180
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:35,489
Those two kids were young but clever.

181
00:14:35,489 --> 00:14:39,599
They left them in my mansion for a better future.

182
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:42,789
Right now, those two children are still in my mansion.

183
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:45,099
Your Majesty, you can summon them and ask them about it.

184
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:47,420
They are your servants.

185
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,880
There is no doubt that they are on your side.

186
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,750
Their statements can't be trusted.

187
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,129
After Princess Xiping saw these two people in Chang'an,

188
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,059
she worried what she did would be exposed.

189
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,449
So he threatened Doctor Zhang

190
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,490
in the Imperial Medical Service who knows that fact.

191
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:06,390
Your Grace, you harbor the survivor of the rebellious party first,

192
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,700
then you deceived the emperor.

193
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,699
To conceal the truth,

194
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:14,390
you cruelly forced Doctor Zhang to commit suicide.

195
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,710
I have the evidence and the witnesses.

196
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:21,040
Your Grace, don't you plead guilty?

197
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,100
Xiping, what else do you want to say?

198
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,380
Your Majesty, I didn't kill Zhang Shu.

199
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:35,810
Besides, Jinyu and Jinli are both my flesh and blood.

200
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,790
I have nothing else to say.

201
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,290
Commandery Prince An has arrived.

202
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,730
I have something to say.

203
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,980
Xiao Jinyu pays respects to Your Majesty.

204
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,220
You may rise.

205
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,979
You said you have something to say.

206
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,260
What do you want to say?

207
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,649
Your Majesty, I heard Minister Han's inference when I was outside.

208
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:15,609
I think Minister Han's inference is full of loopholes.

209
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:19,659
Commandery Prince An, you are suspected of being a son of a rebel.

210
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:22,440
You don't have the right to talk nonsense here.

211
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,020
Xiao Jinyu, then explain his loopholes to me.

212
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,009
The medical record presented by Minister Han

213
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,560
must have been deliberately forged by someone else.

214
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,330
Well, well, Commandery Prince An.

215
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,160
That's really a desperate move.

216
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,989
You are really lying through your teeth.

217
00:16:41,989 --> 00:16:44,179
You haven't seen the record.

218
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:48,010
How can you be so sure?

219
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,840
Minister Han, have you ever thought about

220
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,379
that if Doctor Zhang was really in a desperate situation

221
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,789
and he wanted to keep his family safe,

222
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:58,380
why would he put the medical record on the table

223
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,480
to let you discover it?

224
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,559
After he died, someone would search the room.

225
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:06,329
If anyone sees the medical record and suspects Princess Xiping,

226
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,429
then Princess Xiping kills his family after she learns it,

227
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:11,750
doesn't it mean that he died for nothing?

228
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:18,960
Maybe Doctor Zhang wanted to use his death to reveal the truth.

229
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,309
What a joke.

230
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:22,229
Zhang Shu is not a common person.

231
00:17:22,229 --> 00:17:23,560
As the head of the Imperial Medical Service,

232
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,190
he has more chances to meet His Majesty than us.

233
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,229
Even if he really wanted to report anything,

234
00:17:28,229 --> 00:17:30,810
does he need to give up his life?

235
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:36,850
Your Majesty, I want to check the pulse record Minister Han talked about.

236
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:39,890
Han Ji, show it to him.

237
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,800
Your Majesty, the paper of the pulse record is old.

238
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,280
But the ink is new.

239
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,839
Those who ever read account books or registers would know

240
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,360
that even the same person uses the same pen and ink to write,

241
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,050
the handwriting would vary a little bit every day.

242
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:14,159
But this volume which recorded Princess' pulse for nearly one year

243
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,740
is consistent in terms of its handwriting.

244
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,850
What's even stranger is

245
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,930
that the inked used in this record

246
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,519
is the fragrance-free ink developed three years ago in Shezhou.

247
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,800
The fragrance-free ink greatly reduces the burned odor of the ink itself

248
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,050
with its extremely delicate ink-making process.

249
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,500
Unlike the previous method of making ink,

250
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,790
spices should be added to the ink to cover the burned odor.

251
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,660
That's why it's called fragrance-free ink.

252
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,040
This ink is only used in the palace.

253
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,580
Even if he got this ink from somewhere else,

254
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,780
how would he use it to transcribe a volume of pulse records?

255
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,449
I never granted the fragrance-free ink to anyone in the Imperial Medical Service.

256
00:19:01,449 --> 00:19:05,260
Han Ji, what is this about?

257
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,210
What happened to Doctor Zhang?

258
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:19,560
Your Highness, he was hanged.

259
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,220
Really?

260
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,729
There is a black-purple strangulation mark on the front of his neck

261
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,239
and below his Adam's apple.

262
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:29,060
That's why his mouth is slightly open and his tongue sticks out.

263
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:33,089
This strangulation mark spreads from the front of his neck to his ear.

264
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,910
And there is bruising on his legs.

265
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,309
He was hanged.

266
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:41,819
But... I don't think he hanged himself.

267
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,089
Why?

268
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:48,690
Because some bruises on his body

269
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,449
should be caused by fighting with someone else before he died.

270
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,679
But it doesn't look like face-to-face fighting.

271
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,739
What do you mean?

272
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,699
He has bruises on his wrists that were clearly being grabbed hard.

273
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,739
But other bruises on his body

274
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,380
are mostly on the sides and back of his limbs.

275
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,620
I don't know how they fought.
[Bruises on arms, legs and back]

276
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,530
Where are these bruises?

277
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,369
He has striped bruises on the outside of his left leg.

278
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:22,979
It was caused by hitting something hard.
[Striped bruises on left legs Collision]

279
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,180
[Striped bruises on left legs Collision]

280
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,550
Your Highness, let's try it?

281
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,110
Okay.

282
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,960
[Striped bruise on arms]

283
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,260
[Scratches on legs]

284
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,330
If he struggled in this way,

285
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,350
would he have bruises

286
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:11,250
on the back or side of his limbs?

287
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,660
Yes, it must be like this.

288
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,520
But why did this person fight with Doctor Zhang like this?

289
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,370
Doctor Zhang is over 60.

290
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,580
He doesn't practice martial arts.

291
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,360
It's not difficult to take him down with a heavy blow.

292
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,970
Why would that person go through all these troubles?

293
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,400
I know it.

294
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,959
He wanted to smother Doctor Zhang on the bed and make him faint.

295
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:44,820
Then he hanged him on the beam.

296
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,990
In this way, it would look like he hanged himself.

297
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,709
I found some white floc in the deceased's nose.

298
00:21:55,709 --> 00:21:57,910
I was wondering what it was.

299
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,510
Now I know it's the cotton in the quilt.

300
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,759
When the killer smothered him,

301
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,800
he must have sucked it in when he was struggling.

302
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,750
But... those who discovered the deceased

303
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,869
saw him kick away the stool in front of them.

304
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:14,689
I heard that when they saw the deceased,

305
00:22:14,689 --> 00:22:17,950
he was still dangling on the beam.

306
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,750
If he was really killed in this way,

307
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:25,630
does it mean the two doctors who discovered the deceased lied?

308
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,730
Your Majesty, I found out

309
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,890
Doctor Zhang Shu didn't commit suicide.

310
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,580
He was smothered with a quilt until he fainted

311
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,260
and then was hanged on the beam.

312
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,130
That's nonsense.

313
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,759
The two doctors saw it with their own eyes

314
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:46,769
that Doctor Zhang kicked down the stool by himself.

315
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:49,789
But he was old and weak and he didn't make it.

316
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:53,420
Who discovered Zhang Shu's death on that day?

317
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,899
Let me ask you.

318
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:01,269
Did you see it with your own eyes

319
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:04,340
that Zhang Shu kicked the stool down by himself?

320
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,090
Yes.

321
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:11,530
Your Majesty, I believe they are not lying.

322
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,919
Commandery Prince An.

323
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,049
You said that Doctor Zhang was murdered.

324
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,399
Then you said the two doctors are not lying.

325
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,880
What do you mean?

326
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:24,230
Zhang Shu was murdered.

327
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,440
And the two doctors are not lying.

328
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,610
It's just the murderer tricked them into believing that they saw

329
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,539
Doctor Zhang kick down the stool and commit suicide.

330
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:34,799
Wise Your Majesty.

331
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,720
Wise Commandery Prince An.

332
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,820
Your Majesty, the room next door...

333
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,780
is exactly the same as where the crime happened.

334
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,150
I've recreated the crime scene.

335
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:48,159
Please go there and see

336
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,930
how the murderer deceived them.

337
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,560
Okay.

338
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:19,260
Your Majesty, the room has been arranged just as the crime scene.

339
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,670
We only need to relive the night

340
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,049
when the two doctors found the deceased,

341
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:25,310
then the truth will come to light.

342
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,300
Your Majesty, let me do it.

343
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,880
Doctors, was the door like this

344
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,100
before you pushed the door at that time?

345
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,900
- Yes.
- Yes.

346
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:45,610
Minister Han, please.

347
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,820
How did it happen?

348
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,330
Well...

349
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,510
Doctors, is this what you heard and saw at that time?

350
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,069
Yes, exactly.

351
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,179
Exactly the same.

352
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,760
How is it possible?

353
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,560
The wooden dummy can't kick over the stool by itself.

354
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,599
This is just a little trick the murderer used.

355
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,880
Your Majesty, after the murderer smothered Doctor Zhang,

356
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:01,620
he used this rope to make Doctor Zhang look like that he committed suicide.

357
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:10,309
Then he put the stool diagonally at the feet of the deceased.

358
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:13,270
The deceased's feet were against the stool.

359
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,830
Then he put a brush

360
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,200
against the stool to support it.

361
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,460
He left the door half open

362
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:24,380
and placed the rod between the door and the stool.

363
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,949
When someone pushes the door,

364
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,460
the rod would hit the brush

365
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,909
and the stool would fall to the ground.

366
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:30,750
The brush would roll away

367
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:34,640
and the corpse would dangle from the beam.

368
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,940
Save him!

369
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,610
This is what the two doctors saw at the time.

370
00:26:54,970 --> 00:27:00,570
Your Majesty, this is the brush I just put under the stool.

371
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,840
And this brush was found in Doctor Zhang's room.

372
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,830
If you compare them carefully,

373
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,459
you can find out that the ends of these two brushes

374
00:27:10,459 --> 00:27:12,370
have almost the same abrasion marks.

375
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:15,880
The shape of the brush tips is almost the same.

376
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,040
Really.

377
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,409
The herbs and medicine packages that scattered on the ground

378
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:29,029
were also arranged by the murderer to conceal this mechanism,

379
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:31,930
making the brush and the rod on the ground

380
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,860
not too obvious.

381
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,980
Ministers, do you have any objections

382
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,500
to Commandery Prince An's inference?

383
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,560
I have no objection.

384
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,420
I have no objection, either.

385
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:53,830
Xiao Jinyu, if you knew how the murderer killed him,

386
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,520
you must also know who the murderer is.

387
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,360
The murderer took all these efforts to set this trap.

388
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,120
But he made a fatal mistake.

389
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,579
After the murderer set up the mechanism,

390
00:28:07,579 --> 00:28:09,800
he had to leave the room through the window.

391
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,980
When the murderer jumped out of the window that night,

392
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,790
a silk thread was hooked down

393
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,620
by a splinter on the window.

394
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,249
It seems to be...

395
00:28:26,249 --> 00:28:27,720
Wise Your Majesty.

396
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,009
This silk thread is from the inside lining of the eunuch's clothes.

397
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:41,330
Eunuch Sun, there is your name on the access records

398
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,110
of the Imperial Medical Service at that night.

399
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:47,059
It also matches the time when Doctor Zhang was murdered.

400
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:51,429
After investigation, Eunuch Sun hasn't applied for a new official uniform.

401
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:56,349
Can you show your inside lining to us?

402
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,030
Your... Your Highness, what do you mean?

403
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:10,450
Your Majesty, he is the murderer!

404
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,009
Your Majesty, I know nothing about it.

405
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:17,730
I really know nothing.

406
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,919
Your...

407
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,520
Master! Master!

408
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,250
Master, save me!

409
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,139
Master! Master!

410
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:30,480
Save me, Master! Master!

411
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,870
Save me!

412
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,860
You...!

413
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,709
How dare you commit a crime in front of His Majesty!

414
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:02,579
Your Majesty, this villain committed such a felony.

415
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,680
It's my fault that I failed to discipline him.

416
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,470
Today, Commandery Prince An has found out the truth.

417
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,630
The evidence is irrefutable to convict him.

418
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:17,790
I'm in charge of the Palace Domestic Service.

419
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:22,180
It's my duty to punish the eunuchs.

420
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:27,560
Even this villain called me his teacher,

421
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,519
I can't tolerate him.

422
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,790
I have to punish him severely.

423
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:38,700
Your Majesty, I was a little hasty.

424
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:44,439
But if this villain hurts Your Majesty out of desperation,

425
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:48,480
it will be too late to regret it.

426
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,640
Your Majesty, I'm loyal to you.

427
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,420
Please understand me.

428
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,660
Eunuch Qin, I don't think you only want to punish Sun Mingde.

429
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,970
You are afraid that if you don't kill him now,

430
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:15,159
he would confess how you want to use Zhang Shu's death

431
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:18,429
to falsely accuse my mother of harboring the son of a rebel

432
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:21,410
and deceiving His Majesty,

433
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:25,309
as to prevent me from returning to Chang'an with the irrefutable evidence

434
00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:28,400
to reveal how you called white black

435
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,880
and wrongfully killed the Military Commissioner of Jiannan.

436
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:45,920
Commandery Prince An,

437
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:51,739
you just convicted Sun Mingde in front of His Majesty

438
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:55,600
and these ministers.

439
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,490
Right?

440
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:01,860
I believed your inference

441
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:07,310
and executed this villain on the spot!

442
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:12,279
Now you are saying something like this.

443
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:17,429
Look! I really can't understand you now.

444
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:24,299
Your Majesty, I beg for justice.

445
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:28,539
Xiao Jinyu, how is this about the Military Commissioner of Jiannan now?

446
00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:32,179
What's going on? Make it clear.

447
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:38,050
Your Majesty, I went to the Southwest this time

448
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:41,009
and found my father, the Investigating Censor of Emperor Wenzong,

449
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:45,910
who had been missing for years.

450
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:49,830
My father passed away in Qianzhou five years ago.

451
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:52,730
I've brought his body back to Chang'an.

452
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:55,070
My father left some evidence before he died.

453
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:59,689
He also encrypted what happened to him at that time

454
00:32:59,689 --> 00:33:02,300
and wrote it down in his last words.

455
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:07,270
Please allow me to present you his last words and other evidence.

456
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,610
Okay.

457
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,210
Your Highness.

458
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,310
Your Highness, something has gone wrong.

459
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,890
Everyone in Xue's Mansion disappeared.

460
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:29,899
What?

461
00:33:29,899 --> 00:33:32,890
I can't get any news from the Ministry of War.

462
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:37,139
What's more, Commandery Prince An has returned to Chang'an.

463
00:33:37,139 --> 00:33:40,270
He is back alive,

464
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:42,249
which means they failed to seize the base.

465
00:33:42,249 --> 00:33:44,379
Don't tell anyone about this failure.

466
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,739
Your Highness, it's dangerous in Chang'an now.

467
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,259
You'd better make a plan now.

468
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,740
Make a plan now?

469
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:56,640
I've been planning and preparing for more than ten years with all my efforts.

470
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,810
It had nothing to do with him.

471
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,760
But he has to go against me.

472
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,310
He can't blame me then.

473
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:06,619
Have you arranged the people and the places as I asked you?

474
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:11,679
Your Highness, don't worry. I've arranged it properly.

475
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,420
Xiao Jinyu,

476
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,230
I'm your teacher.

477
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:35,320
Do you think you can get out of my hand?

478
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:54,230
Your Majesty, I've written down how I found my father's letter

479
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:57,539
and the deciphered content of the letter in the memorial.

480
00:34:57,539 --> 00:34:59,570
Please take a look.

481
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:15,340
My father was ordered to go to the Southwest in secret

482
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,999
and summon the Military Commissioner, Chen Ying, to suppress the bandits.

483
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,119
[Summon the Military Commissioner, Chen Ying to suppress the bandits.]

484
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,580
Chen Ying led more than 20,000 men to Chang'an by order.

485
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,149
But they were falsely accused by the eunuchs of being rebels

486
00:35:25,149 --> 00:35:27,490
and were brutally slaughtered.

487
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:30,650
My father tried to prove their innocence

488
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:33,640
and broke out of the siege with the secret edict.

489
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:38,289
Qin Luan's party was afraid of my father's returning to Chang'an to reveal the truth,

490
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:42,819
so they had been setting ambushes and planting informers in Chang'an

491
00:35:42,819 --> 00:35:46,170
and sending people to the Southwest to hunt him down and kill him.

492
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:50,249
My father couldn't return to Chang'an to redress their grievances before he died.

493
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,469
I went to the Southwest this time and followed the clues left by my father,

494
00:35:54,469 --> 00:35:56,189
then I found out my father's letter

495
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,660
and the evidence he left before he died.

496
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,940
That's when I learned

497
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:04,350
the grievances of tens of thousands of loyal men buried in the Southwest.

498
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:07,659
Your Majesty, I beg you to re-investigate the case

499
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:13,569
and clear the name of Chen Ying and other loyal generals and soldiers.

500
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,840
Qin Luan.

501
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,640
Your Majesty, I took the order of Emperor Wenzong

502
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,429
and led troops to the Southwest to suppress the rebels.

503
00:36:25,429 --> 00:36:28,040
Everybody knew it in the court.

504
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:33,429
Commandery Prince An was not born at the time of the incident in the Southwest.

505
00:36:33,429 --> 00:36:38,320
After so many years, he just went to the Southwest,

506
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,049
brought back an old corpse

507
00:36:41,049 --> 00:36:45,130
and some so-called evidence that is easy to forge

508
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:49,369
to mislead people and call white black.

509
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:54,309
I think Commandery Prince An is distorting the fact with his glib tongue

510
00:36:54,309 --> 00:36:57,670
to exonerate Princess Xiping and himself.

511
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:01,229
Your Majesty, this matter is of great importance.

512
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,560
Wise Your Majesty.

513
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:15,130
Your Majesty, I have another piece of evidence

514
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:18,370
that can prove that Qin Luan is not innocent.

515
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:21,359
What else do you have? Take it out.

516
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,680
Chu Chu from the Three Judicial Offices

517
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,600
greets Your Majesty.

518
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,580
Your Majesty, look.

519
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:48,150
She is the daughter of Yun Yi the rebel.

00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:44,309
♫  I’m still young, with my love not yet realized for you, but I'm
willing to be here for you till the end

532
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:51,280
♫  You can rely on me in this lifetime  ♫

533
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:59,970
♫  Hope to spend this beautiful lifetime together  ♫
