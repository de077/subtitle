80
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,160
I knew!

81
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,209
His look is odd because it's like something that's pieced together.

82
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:01,139
Something that's pieced together?

83
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,870
Yes. People look different from each other.

84

But people born in the same regions share similarities in looks.

85

People from Chang'an also have a mold.

89

But Manager Xu's face isn't shaped by any of those molds.

90
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,900
His face looks as if someone shattered many molds

91
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,880
and took parts from those molds to piece together.

but I've never seen a man who looks like this.

95
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,760
This is so weird.

96
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,200
What if his parents or ancestors are descendants from other regions?

97
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,230
That's not the case either.

For example, Mules are born from donkeys and horses.

99

Mules don't look exactly like donkeys, nor horses.

However, in every part of mules,

101
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,369
you can find features of both donkeys and horses.

102
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,270
It seems that the eyes of Lingnan people,

00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,869
the forehead of Jiangnan people, and the chin of Goryeo people

105
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,690
are all assembled on a face from people who're inside Shanhai Pass.

106
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,450
Xu Rugui might have disguised his look.

107
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,190

Even if he has miraculous drawing techniques,

115
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:40,640
he can only draw my falsified look.

When my natural face was hidden,

117
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,640
Xiao Jinyu was still an infant in the cradle.

118
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,760
He definitely can't recognize me even if I stand right before him.

119
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,720

Yes. I always see him take out keys from his left sleeve.

133

Wu Jiang and I have tried all of them. They all lead to the outside.

141

But it seems more likely that he fled when he knew we'd search this place.

153
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:33,760
And he tried to burn the evidences,

154
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,739
but didn't put everything in the stove before he fled because he was in a hurry.

155

156
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,010

Jing Yi, does the chamber have a place that requires keys?

166
00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:06,689
No. It's just a dark chamber. There's nothing more besides the exits.

167
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:09,599
Xu Rugui has a chain of keys that he habitually stores in his right sleeve.

If those are not for the dark chamber,

169

00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:25,960
This should be the place.

188
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,239
Your Highness, this place seems to be a small square on the chessboard,

189
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:34,899
but, in reality, it spreads across over 20 hectares.

190
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:37,580
Over a hundred families live there.

191
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,790
There was mud and rice paste mixture at the bottom of his shoes.

192
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,859
There must be a residence. This place seems to be closed to the house under construction.

Ask them to carefully interrogate every person who enters or exits the city.

Those without an ID or with a suspicious one mustn't exit the city

At our place, every household knows how to make such pickled cabbages.

only to find that Zhou Han, from Shen Army,

302

just led a group of people and left the city thirty minutes ago.

303

Did the guards search them before letting them leave?

304
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,749
They did. But they found nothing suspicious.

305
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,110
Such a coincidence.

306
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,449
These men in black seem to be there just to buy Zhou Han more time.

Currently, the tally isn't kept at the place it's usually stored.

315
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,059
Xu Rugui might have just gone to

he will retrieve the money immediately before he flees for life.

Take Xu Rugui's portrait with you.

Interrogate the owner of Ruyi Pawnshop.

Keep an eye on it.

324
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:49,109
Whoever goes to retrieve money is the killer.

Chu Chu's birth date has been confirmed.

Her father's wife has been deceased for years.

333
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,849
The neighborhood knew Chu Chu as Chu Ping's daughter out of wedlock.

334
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,270
The identity of her birth mother is unclear.

335

Chu Family led a simple life in the neighborhood.

336

They only had close ties with a lonely witch doctor,

337
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,170
who left the region five years ago,

338
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,150
and is still missing to this day.

No, Your Highness.

00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,590
They're indeed from Shen Army.

352
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,730
There was one corpse on the flat wagon.

353
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,239
The dead was dressed in Shence Army's uniform.

354
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,559
But his face looked unfamiliar.

00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,089
It's said that he died of pestilence.

00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,529
They were in a hurry to burn him outside the city.

357
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,799
Just one dead man?

358
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,309
Yes, just one.

359
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,610
No.

360
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:49,029
I mean there was only one corpse on the flat wagon?

361
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,080
Yes, indeed.

362
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,279
A flat wagon, a rider, and a corpse.

363
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,620
How can the tracks be so deep?

364
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,519
Have you checked under the wagon?

365
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,270
No.

366
00:21:06,271 --> 00:21:09,960
My attention was caught by the corpse on the wagon.

367
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,639
This is a cover-up.

368
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,840
I'm afraid there was another person under the wagon.

369
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,530
Let them exit.

370
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,999
Your Highness, I'm sorry—

371
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,219
It's okay. This happened too quickly. It's not your fault.

372
00:21:23,219 --> 00:21:26,260
Examine more carefully in the future.

373
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,980
I believe Zhou Han will come back soon.

374
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,419
Just let them get back to the city.

375
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,659
Don't say a thing. Just pretend you know nothing.

376
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,879
- I'll send someone to handle the rest.
- Yes.

377
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,290
He even figured that out?

378
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,109
It's midnight already. What happened?

379
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,279
Where's Jinyu?

380
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,250
His Highness is all right.

381
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,100
It's just...

382
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,819
His Highness is so busy with work that

383
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,099
he hasn't had a chance to see Your Grace.

384
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:52,479
His Highness misses Your Grace.

385
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,909
So he ordered me to come and strengthen the defense at Princess's Manor

386
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:57,799
to express his filial piety.

387
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,879
Why should he strengthen guards if everything is going well?

388
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,620
I know martial arts and I have guards.

389
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:06,040
Why do you come to my place when you should be protecting him?

390
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,669
I heard that the mourning hall of Feng Manor was on fire tonight.

391
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:12,809
Did Jinyu ignore His Majesty's orders and again make a scene at Feng Manor?

392
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:14,939
- I'll go and find him now!
- Your Grace, don't be angry.

393
00:22:14,939 --> 00:22:17,659
Your Grace, Scholar Xue has told you that

394
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:20,059
you mustn't intervene with His Highness's work.

395
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:22,779
That's harmful to His Highness's reputation in the office.

396
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:25,249
His Highness has been always discreet since childhood.

397
00:22:25,249 --> 00:22:27,569
Your Grace, you should trust him.

398
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:30,210
How can I trust him when he has caused so much trouble?

399
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,679
Your Grace, His Highness promised to come here after work.

400
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,720
Just wait a bit longer.

401
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,249
Your Grace, His Highness is a man of his words.

402
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:49,169
He promised to come here later. Then he will.

403
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:53,420
Why don't you sit down and think about how you'll scold him later?

404
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,179
Otherwise, it'll be like the usual days.

405
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:58,570
Before you can give a good talking, His Highness will have already changed the subject.

406
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:02,630
Then, you'll blame me instead.

407
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,430
Fine. Just leave.

408
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,720
You!

409
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,700
You're always on his side.

410
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,750
Master, you finally came out.

411
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,720
His Majesty...

412
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,610
It's fine.

413
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,440
How are things doing out there?

414
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,849
Master, don't worry. Everything is going well.

415
00:23:58,849 --> 00:24:02,480
He has left the city.

416
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,900
It's finally dawn. This night is too long.

417
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:18,150
His Majesty said that he was afraid that someone may devour Xiao Jinyu alive.

418
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:22,910
Who do you think should be that person?

419
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:29,190
Devour Xiao Jinyu.

420
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,580
Devour Xiao Jinyu.

421
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,100
Devour?

422
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,720
Who?

423
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,020
[Tonghua Gate]

424
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,660
Commandery Prince An is right.

425
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,680
Chu Chu.

426
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,879
Go back and take some rest.

427
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,329
You've been busy working with me all night. You must be tired.

428
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:19,820
Thank you, Your Highness.

429
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,560
Are you coming or not?

430
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,810
I have other matters.

431
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,740
Then when will you come back?

432
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,010
Why are you asking?

433
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:30,260
I just find you rather pale.

434
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,110
Come back to rest when you're done with work.

435
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,760
Okay.

436
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,540
Wait.

437
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,879
I didn't have the chance to ask you earlier.

438
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,279
What's the embroidery on your handkerchief? It's a bone.

439
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:50,869
The fifth rib bone on the left chest.

440
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,570
Rib bone?

441
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,170
Why that?

442
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:58,180
Because it's the closest place to a person's heart.

443
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,250
When you put your hand on the bone's position,

444
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,440
you can feel your heartbeat.

445
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,229
That's my favorite bone.

446
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,780
Do you find it beautiful?

447
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,600
Yes.

448
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,280
Go.

449
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,150
You embroidered this?

450
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,500
If you don't like it...

451
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,140
Your Highness, there you are!

452
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,840
Where's Her Grace?

453
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,630
She's inside.

454
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:03,580
Jinyu, where have you been all night?

455
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,059
Come closer. Let me see if you're hurt.

456
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,760
No, Mother, don't worry.

457
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,489
You caused so much disturbance in the middle of the night.

458
00:27:12,489 --> 00:27:14,870
Everyone was worried because of you.

459
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,509
If you don't explain everything clearly today,

460
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:20,619
I'll greet His Majesty and ask him to remove you from Three Judicial Chief Ministries.

461
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:23,339
Mother, calm down. You can interrogate me today.

462
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:26,010
I'll tell you everything honestly.

463
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,830
Wu Jiang, take the guards and leave.

464
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,360
Yes.

465
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:35,249
I've been busy all night. I didn't even have water.

466
00:27:35,249 --> 00:27:36,569
Can I beg for a cup of tea?

467
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,430
Tea?

468
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,910
You won't even get cold water.

469
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,450
Miss Chu,

470
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,700
let me help you change the medicine.

471
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,850
No. No need. I can do it myself.

472
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,210
These are just minor wounds.

473
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:12,030
When I made baskets at home,

474
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,779
my hands always got scratched.

475
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:15,910
I never whined because of the pain.

476
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,439
You're so brave.

477
00:28:17,439 --> 00:28:20,300
No, I'm not.

478
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:24,410
I'm nothing compared with His Highness.

479
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:28,160
Chu Chu. Chu Chu.

480
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,400
Chu Chu.

481
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,059
By the way, can I ask you for something?

482
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,349
What is it, Miss Chu?

483
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,580
His Highness has given us the order.

484
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,879
You can have whatever you want so long as it's not livestock

485
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,830
or growable seeds or seedlings.

486
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,460
I want a spoon.

487
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,560
A spoon?

488
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,559
Miss Chu, if you want to eat something,

489
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,310
you can ask the kitchen to cook it.

490
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,230
You don't have to do it yourself.

491
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:10,300
No. I'm not trying to cook.

492
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,210
I just want a spoon.

493
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,000
A spoon of this size.

494
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,100
This size?

495
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,109
Fine. Mother. I'm already full.

496
00:29:25,109 --> 00:29:26,579
Eat more.

497
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:28,039
Look at how pale you are!

498
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,919
You must have stayed up late for days.

499
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,329
Banxia, go to the kitchen.

500
00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:34,530
Bring out the calm stews if it's cooked.

501
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:39,369
Your Grace, didn't you just say you won't even give His Highness cold water?

502
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:41,429
Of course, I won't.

503
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,320
How can he drink cold water on such a freezing day?

504
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,419
Go and check it. Bring out calm stew if it's cooked.

505
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:47,160
Yes.

506
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:58,679
Mother, I'm here today because I want to ask you something.

507
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,829
You promised to let me interrogate you today.

508
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,929
You are to break the promise after lunch?

509
00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:05,670
Now, you'll interrogate me?

510
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,600
Don't you want to know what happened last night?

511
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,140
Take a look at this first.

512
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,380
[Xiao Jinyu...]

513
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,260
[Lynched the remaining members of Chen Ying's party...]

514
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,260
[Xiao Heng escaped luckily...]

515
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,520
Mother.

516
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,100
Banxia. Guard the door.

517
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,490
Don't let anyone enter without my permission.

518
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,990
Yes.

519
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,109
Where are these from?

520
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,410
A tavern named Rugui Tavern in the city.

521
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:07,810
A tavern?

522
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:10,559
Why would a tavern investigate your father?

523
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,170
That's why I want to ask you.

524
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,479
Ask me? How can I know?

525
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,559
The man who made these investigation records has fled upon sensing danger.

526
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:24,220
My men are still hunting him.

527
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:28,750
These are what he has left behind in a sealed chamber at Rugui Tavern.

528
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,759
There were more records about other people.

529
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,279
They were destroyed by fire.

530
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,759
Among the few scrolls remained, there's one that's about father.

531
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,460
If I'm not mistaken, that man left this intentionally to me.

532
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,310
He left this to you on purpose?

533
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,380
Why would he do that?

534
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,330
[25th, Princess Xiping Manor's Banquet]

535
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:55,970
On last month's 25th, did you throw a banquet at the manor?

536
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:01,200
I invited Madam Jing.

537
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,090
Someone is spying on us.

538
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:07,629
So, I didn't allow Wu Jiang to explain everything clearly to you last night.

539
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:09,050
Mother, please forgive me.

540
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,309
The audacity!

541
00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:12,130
Mother, don't be mad.

542
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,160
Tell me. Whay do they spy on me for?

543
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,629
They want to find out something from you.

544
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,109
What do they want to know?

545
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,550
Mother, I'm wishing you to tell me.

546
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,610
How can I know?

547
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,990
Mother, father passed away years ago.

548
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,879
His remains are buried under Chang'an.

549
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,430
Why are they going through all this trouble to spy on you, me,

550
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,279
and those who had ties with father?

551
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,880
It seems...

552
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:43,570
It seems that they're searching for his whereabouts.

553
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,890
Nonsense.

554
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:58,030
A few days ago, I saw the other half of this pendant.

555
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,279
Where did you see it?

556
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,020
It's in the hands of a girl from Qianzhou.

557
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,890
A girl from Qianzhou.

558
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:08,369
Is that the coroner you brought to Feng Manor to send your condolence?

559
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:09,880
Yes.

560
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,470
Then, she...

561
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,819
Mother, don't rush.

562
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,040
It's still under investigation.

563
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,960
No.

564
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,959
Ask your men to fall back. Order them to come back.

565
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:22,749
Kick that coroner out of Three Judicial Chief Ministries.

566
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,269
No, kick her out of Chang'an. You can't keep investigating this case.

567
00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:27,610
Why?

568
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:32,930
Mother, about father, are you keeping secrets?

569
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,919
Now, the enemies are hiding in the dark. We're exposed.

570
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,460
This is unfavorable to us.

571
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,260
Mother, please tell me everything truthfully.

572
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,150
Master.

573
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,910
Mingde is here.

574
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,410
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

575
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,420
Put them down carefully.

576
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,520
Put them down.

577
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,710
You two. Leave. Go.

578
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,820
Yes.

579
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,610
- Close the door.
- Go ahead with your work.

580
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,360
Master.

581
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,370
Look. Everything is here.

582
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,990
Except those we've burned

583
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:08,760
and those you ordered to be left to Xiao Jinyu,

584
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,960
every other scroll is here.

585
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,480
Has Xiao Jinyu taken action?

586
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,569
Just as you've expected, Xiao Jinyu ordered his Chief Guardsman,

587
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:30,659
Wu Jiang, to lead a team of guards

588
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,899
and stand by at Princess Xiping Manor.

589
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,219
They only left when Xiao Jinyu himself arrived.

590
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,559
I guess our wise and assertive Commandery Prince An

591
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:44,630
is now shaking Princess Xiping's sleeves and begging for his father.

592
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,820
Prince Consort secretly reported the treason of Chen Ying,

593
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,269
the Military Commissioner of Jiannan, to the imperial court.

594
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,870
Prince Consort was tragically murdered by Chen Ying.

595
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:01,810
When I led Shen Army to suppress the rebellion at His Majesty's behest.

596
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,699
It was too late.

597
00:35:03,699 --> 00:35:05,359
These are what I can bring back.

598
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,270
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

599
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,829
His Majesty is impressed by Prince Consort's loyalty.

600
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,919
His Majesty has decreed the conferment.

601
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,140
Your Grace, please take it.

602
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:22,919
- I've never imagined that you father would disappear like that.
- No.

603
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:28,329
So, father's current grave in Chang'an is a cenotaph.

604
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:34,090
Besides accepting it, what else can I do?

605
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:38,960
The Imperial Court at that time was so different from the current one.

606
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,209
The conflict between ministers and eunuchs were so heated.

607
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,849
When we heard your father's death in Chang'an,

608
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:48,230
Chang'an was caught in Ganlu Incident.

609
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,389
The North Yamen led by eunuchs were on a killing spree.

610
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,869
The South Yamen led by Prime Minister were slaughtered.

611
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:59,710
Even my father was confined in the imperial palace.

612
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:03,679
The conferment decree for your father was already ordered.

613
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:06,609
Leng Family, from the Southwest, supports me.

614
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:10,699
But if I insist to seek justice from the Imperial Court, considering the situation,

615
00:36:10,699 --> 00:36:14,890
I would've already brought calamities on you and your brother before the justice could be upheld.

616
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:20,900
Mother, it seems that...father might still be alive.

617
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:33,060
