[Episode 1]

4
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,980
In the middle and late Tang Dynasty,

5
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,020
eunuchs set Emperor Xuanzong on the throne.

6
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,799
To please them,

7
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,039
Emperor Xuanzong let them take charge of Imperial Armies

8
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,120
to keep the Imperial Palace safe.

9
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,900
Meanwhile, he established Three Judicial Offices,

10
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:46,480
making Commandery Prince An, Xiao Jinyu, managing all criminal cases.

11
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,140
Three Judicial Chief Ministries values coroners.

12
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,720
The Coroner Qualification Exam is held in the capital every year,

13
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,189
without any restriction.

14
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,410
Talented people will be recruited.

15
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,629
During the exam season,
[Jinguang Gate]

16
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,850
coroners from different towns come to the capital.

17
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,759
Here you are.

18
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,909
See you. See you.

19
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,610
Come again!

20
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,900
Have a look at the hairpins.

21
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,080
Miss, have a look.

22
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,980
What's this?

23
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,979
It's food.

00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,010
[Chu Chu]

25
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,420
I'm here in Chang'an, at last.

26
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,799
I will pass the exam for coroner.

27
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,900
Handsome Judge, wait for me.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,909
Stop.

29
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,610
Show me your pass.

You can go.

33
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,570
Come and have a look.

34
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,669
Make way, please.

35
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,669
Come and have a look! Come and have a look!

[Jing Yi, Vice Minister of the Court of Judicial Review]

37
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,439
Elder, what happened to you?

38
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,269
The old man was hit.

39
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,650
Are you all right?

40
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,719
I'm terribly sorry.

41
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,160
Shall I take you to see a physician?

42
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,960
I don't want to waste your time.

43
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,910
It doesn't matter.

44
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,959
I'm old already.

45
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,830
The bruise looks strange.

46
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,820
But now that I'm hurt,

47
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,079
I can't work in the fields for months.

48
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,170
Why is it red, but not swollen?

49
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,860
I don't have money to see a physician.

50
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,189
If you don't mind,

51
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,500
could you give me a bit of money for medical expenses?

52
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,659
- All right.
- I should do that.

53
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:35,519
He certainly should.

54
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,470
The old man was hit so badly.

55
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,170
Wait!

56
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,029
Thank you.

57
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,239
Thank you. Here you go.

58
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,469
- Elder, here you go.
- Thank you.

59
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,340
Thank you.

60
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,389
You lied! The bruise is fake!

61
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,519
What's she talking about?

62
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,780
Lied?

63
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,910
You faked the bruise to deceive people.

64
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,629
It feels a bit hot, but it's not swollen at all.

65
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,629
Everyone, take a look, the bruise has one color.

66
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,269
The edge is clear, too.

67
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,650
Obviously, it's made of burned beech.

68
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,719
Also, he isn't an elder.

69
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,900
The white of his eyes is white.

70
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,959
Shouldn't the white of the eyes

71
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,549
be white? Or can it be black?

72
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,189
It can't be black. But it should be yellow.

73
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,110
When people get old, the white of the eye turns yellow.

74
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,900
The older they are, the more opaque it turns.
[No opaqueness. Over 35 years old.]

75
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,670
This is what we mean by the saying "old and faded".

76
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,270
But, look at him.

77
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,500
The white of his eyes hasn't gone opaque at all.

78
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,319
People can fake their appearance and even voice.

79
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,069
But they can't fake the white of the eye!

80
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,020
- Look at his eyes.
- Go to hell!

81
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,069
Fraud, don't run!

82
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,030

83
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,109
Fraud!

84
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,850
Take him back.

85
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,540
All right. Break it up here.

86
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,829
Don't block the traffic!

87
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,170
Go, go, go.

88
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,269
What a fraud!

89
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,630
He even gave the fraud some money.

90
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,759
Chu Chu?

91
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,250
Yes. You're an official from the Court of Judicial Review?

92
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,670
I'm Jing Yi, Vice Minister of the Court of Judicial Review.

Greetings, Lord Jing.

94
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,930
Stand up, please.

95
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,269
This isn't what ordinary people use.

96
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,199
Tell me. Why did you come to Chang'an?

97
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,499
I'm not a businesswoman. I got a lift with traveling merchants.

98
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:22,569
I'm a coroner. These are my working tools.

99
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,130
Go away! Go away!

00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,669
Let me show you who's blind?

105
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,270
Say, you!

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,340
Greetings, Your Highness!

107
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,479
I'm so sorry.

108
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,360
I didn't know you were here, Your Highness.

109
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,970
According to the Great Tang laws, who rides a horse in downtown will be flogged 50 times.

110
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:14,869
Wu Jiang. Here.

111
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:17,719
Your Highness, I came out to inspect the accounts of the Shen Army

112
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,039
under the command of Eunuch Qin!

113
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,039
He's waiting for me to return...!

114
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,949
Why are you so troublesome?

115
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:27,379
- Lord Wu, Lord Wu, this is used for the toilet. The toilet!
- That's what I want.

116
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,390
He does strict enforcement with no fear for nobilities.

117
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:44,380
Legal and illegal people all obey him.

118
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,870
You said you came to Chang'an to be a coroner.

119
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,540
Do you mean to take the Coroner Qualification Exam?

120
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,669
Yes.

121
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,940
After I pass the exam, I'll be an official coroner.

122
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,760
Is there really no restriction for the Coroner Qualification Exam

123
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,000
and anyone can take part in it?

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,500
Yes.

125
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,940
Go to the exam with this,

127

Excuse me,

133
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,549
didn't we have the exam yesterday?

134

Why is there an exam again today?

135
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,540
You came through the unofficial path, yet you don't know this?

136
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,919
It was the Qualification Exam yesterday.

137
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,999
Now it's the selection exam that Commandery Prince An holds.

138
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,229
Anyone who passes it can be admitted to the Three Judicial Chief Ministries

139

(T/N: Literal translation for Xiao Jinyu)

141
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,829
The name sounds so odd.

142
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,250
What Small Goldfish? You don't even know Commandery Prince An?

143
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,760

- Be smart.

How arrogant he is!

00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,740
Watch your language, Lord Han.

163
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,999
His Highness is your superior.

164
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,279
You must not disrespect him.

165
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,490
What superior?

166
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,279
Since Great Tang Dynasty was founded,

do their duties separately and solve criminal cases together.

169
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,680
I wonder what His Majesty thinks of it.

170
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,959
He established Three Judicial Chief Ministries for Commandery Prince An,

171
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,440
overseeing these three ministries.

172
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,760
Officials like us must take orders from such a young man.

173
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,640

Chu Chu is my name.

It means a lovely girl.

180
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,519
It's simple and easy to be remembered.

181
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,490
Candidate Chu Chu,

182
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,549
there're two parts to the autopsy exam.

183
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,030
Give correct inspections and you'll pass it.

184
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,469
You'll have a high score for offering extra clues.

185
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,959
The final paper subjects to my record.

186
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,999
Do you understand?

187
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,279
Yes.

188
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,250
Then get started, please.

189
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,319
Wait. What are these?

190
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,370
These are autopsy tools I made.
[Yin-yang Pestle]

191
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,839
This is Yin-yang Pestle.

192
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,029
It's made of hardwood.

193
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,319
It has a cone shape, with one thick end and one thin end.

194
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,079
Two ends are wrapped with cotton.

195
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,639
The thin end is for checking the nose

196
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,959
while the thick end is for the throat.

197
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,660
Yin-yang Pestle?

198
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:31,320
He was burned and also soaked in water.

199
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,220
On his arms and neck are lightly bronzing dendritic patterns.

200
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,060
The finger bones of his right hand have pale osseous pearls.

201
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:44,470
The yellow grease on the dead body isn't all solidified grease.

202
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,710
It's...

203
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,720
The smell of sesame oil.

204
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,319
Man, over 35 years old.

205
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,000
Around 1.7 meters tall.

206
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,980
His corpse is burned and curled up.

207
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,360
He died nearly half a month ago.

208
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,010
What's the cause of his death?

209
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:14,440
The results are in his mouth and nose.

210
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,370
I knew it!

211
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,890
There's soot in his mouth and nose.

212
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,589
So, he was burned to death.

213
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,440
What a useful tool!

214
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,730
- What's the nature of this case?
- Nature?

215
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,250
Did he suicide or was he killed?

216
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,439
Neither.

217
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,950
He died of an accident.

218
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,199
Accident?

219
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,759
His skull shows signs of a fractured.

220
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,349
He was burned badly.

221
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:49,199
After cleaning his neck, I saw some dendritic patterns.

222
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,909
He was struck by lightning.

223
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,229
Also, he was soaked in water after he was burned.

224
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:59,469
So, he was struck by lightning before it rained.

225
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,149
It was midsummer half a month ago,

226
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,879
when there are the most thunderstorms.

227
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,999
How could he be burned like this if he was simply struck by lightning?

228
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,710
I think this is how he died.

229
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:17,570
He was, possibly, walking in the rain with a lantern in his hand.

230
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,300
By the way, he was carrying some sesame oil, too.

231
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,000
When the lightning hit the tree,

232
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,930
he was putting his right hand against the tree.

233
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,940
What are you doing?

234
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,860
Stand up and talk normally!

235
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,349
I'm imitating how he died.

236
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,150
Interesting.

237
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,370
Unluckily, he was struck by lightning and passed out immediately.

238
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,840
He got the tinder and flammable sesame oil.

239
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,340
The tinder burned the oil

240
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,980
and burned him to death when he was in a coma.

241
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,780
He was badly burned, but I could feel that

242
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:11,370
he had fractures in his ribs, arms, and shanks

243
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,879
more than once or twice.

244
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:19,109
He was wounded in such vulnerable parts when he risked his life in fights.

245
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,230
If he weren't so badly burned, we could have seen his scars.

246
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,399
No matter what a bad temper he had,

247
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,399
he wouldn't fight people desperately almost every day,

248
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,909
unless that was his job!

249
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,109
What else do you know?

250
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,149
That's all.

251
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,130
My Lord, may I check the next body?

252
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,839
Check her background carefully.
[Exam sheet, Chu Chu, female]

253
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,340
Senior Jing, you have no idea.

254
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,789
The two corpses Commandery Prince An used

255
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:55,670
for the exam are from unsolved cases in the capital.

256
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,570
One of the corpses is Assistant Yan Ming in the Palace Library.

257
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,420
Yan Ming?

258
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,180
Man, over 40 years old.

259
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,549
His corpse has bruises all over.

260
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:12,200
Some flesh of his mouth, nose, chest, and ribs became putrid.

261
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,900
He died half a month ago, I guess.

262
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,789
His heart was stabbed through by a sharp object.

263
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,319
It was the only wound and also the fatal wound.

264
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,080
The sharp object has a spike,

265
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,760
is as thin as wheat straw,

266
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,399
and as long as one meter.

267
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,600
What exactly is the object as thin as wheat straw,

268
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,090
as long as one meter, and with a spike?

269
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,110
I don't know.

270
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,319
You even managed to guess the shape.

271
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,199
Should you be able to guess what the object is?

272
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,999
I didn't guess.

273
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,760
I figured it out.

274
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,150
I was taught

275
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:48,550
that a coroner's duty is to honestly record what he sees,

276
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,790
smells, hears, and touches.

277
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,079
He knows when he sees, smells, hears, and touches.

278
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,690
Otherwise, he doesn't know.

279
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,669
Deducing or judging isn't a coroner's duty.

280
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,370
We can't talk without evidence.

281
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,020
How does she know that?

282
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,060
What?

283
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,709
What I mean is that I told you what I figured out.

284
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,399
I can only tell you what I know.

285
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,759
Without enough evidence, I can't talk nonsense.

286
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,640
I... I also know one thing.

287
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,710
I know he was murdered

288
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,639
and he knew the murderer.

289
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,930
Nonsense!

290
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,109
What?

291
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,560
You want to wake him up and ask him?

292
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,490
I don't mean that.

293
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,490
I mean he knows the murderer

294
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,000
and the murderer knows him, too.

295
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,469
All right.

296
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,280
Go to the Wing Hall for injury inspection.

297
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,080
Thank you, My Lord.

298
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,790
She even knows rules for coroners,

299
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,330
deodorizing the smell by vinegar steaming.

300
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,970
Your Highness.

301
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,249
- She's the female coroner Vice Minister Jing asked you to take care of?
- Yes.

302
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:25,639
Please understand, Your Highness.

303
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,519
If it weren't for his sake,

304
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,050
we wouldn't have let a girl do the autopsy.

305
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,100
You're not qualified to get in.
[Jiangshan Hall]

306
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,420
Please wait here.
[Jiangshan Hall]

307
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,789
Your Majesty, Academician Xue is here.
[Emperor Xuanzong]

308
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,670
Greetings, Your Majesty.
[Xue Rucheng, Academician]

309
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,740
Many officials have been complaining about Commandery Prince An.

310
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,640
You're his teacher. Aren't you going to defend him?

311
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,610
Your Majesty, you think highly of him

312
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,750
and let him take charge of Three Judicial Chief Ministries.

313
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,429
You have your own decision.
[Qin Luan, Acting Chief Eunuch]

314
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,919
I don't need to defend him.

315
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,370
I let him take charge of Three Judicial Chief Ministries,

316
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:21,469
on the account that he's as upright as his father Xiao Heng.

317
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,370
But being an official and solving cases are different things.

318
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,000
Qin Luan.

319
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,010
Yes.

320
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:35,680
I remember when Xiao Heng checked the rebel case in the Southwest,

321
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,130
you went there to help him, right?

322
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:42,420
Yes. You have a good memory, Your Majesty.

323
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,949
At the command of His Majesty,

324
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:49,079
Military Commissioner Chen Ying of Jiannan and Prince Consort Xiao Heng rebelled.

325
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:51,520
They'll be executed right here!

326
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,520
Prince Consort!

327
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,709
Chen Ying!

328
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,310
Prince Consort, go!

329
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,700
You'll have to vindicate our soldiers!

330
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,310
Unfortunately, I was too weak to live up to Emperor Wenzong's trust.

331
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,800
I failed to bring him back alive.

332
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,640
I'm guilty, Your Majesty!

333
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,519
I forgot the manner. Please punish me, Your Majesty.

334
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,709
I noticed you were limping.

335
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,000
Were you flogged?

336
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,420
Who flogged you?

337
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,759
For your information, Your Majesty, when I was going out of town under your command,

338
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,399
I disturbed Commandery Prince An.

339
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,130
His Highness then punished me and had me flogged!

340
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,980
You may both rise.

341
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,150
Academician Xue, didn't you teach Xiao Jinyu

342
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:03,540
to be loyal and considerate?

343
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,589
I neglected my duty to instruct him.

344
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,639
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

345
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,420
As for Sun Mingde...

346
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,559
The Palace Internal Affairs decides how he should be punished.

347
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,919
Today, Xiao Jinyu didn't tell me before he flogged my eunuch.

348
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,960
Will he dare to kill people without telling me?

349
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,039
Don't be angry, Your Majesty.

350
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,970
His Highness was simply so young that he lost his temper.

351
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,650
Now that he has a temper,

352
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,180
you should instruct him properly.

353
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,709
He even uses the corpse of an official for the coroner exam.

354
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:39,510
If he can't solve the case, other officials will impeach him!

355
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,830
By then, I'll punish you, too!

356
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,360
Yes.

357
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,229
Your Highness, Jing Yi is so useless.

358
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,439
He's checking Yan Ming's case for half a month, but he has figured out nothing.

359
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,170
As soon as you take over the case, you've found new clues.

360
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,540
This case is difficult for him.

361
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,709
Your Highness, you think highly of the female coroner?

362
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,350
No.

363
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,920
Jing Yi wants me to notice her.

364
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:15,370
Vice Minister Jing, the next candidate is waiting out there.

365
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,189
How's the examination of bodies going? Has he come?

366
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,189
No.

367
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:23,640
He's in the latrine, because of diarrhea.

368
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,970
Diarrhea might be a big problem.

369
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,000
Have someone check on him.

370
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,400
Ask the next candidate to wait for a moment.

371
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,000
Yes.

372
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,279
Stay here and wait.

373
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,880
Don't run about, make a noise or look around.

374
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,189
When the examination body comes, you can start.

375
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,790
Yes.

376
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,050
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

377
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,589
Is that a girl taking the exam?

378
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:05,479
Yes, Your Highness. She has been in for a while.

379
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,090
He's got a bruise on his forehead.

380
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,490
He must be the examination of body for me.

381
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,280
You're the examination body, right?

382
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,449
What took you so long? I've been waiting for a while.

383
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,039
My Lord, he has come.

384
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,469
May I start now?

385
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,250
How dare you!

386
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,850
You can.

387
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,340
Vice Minister Jing.

388
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,000
Lord Jing.

389
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,350
The candidate and the examination body have come.

390
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,370
Examination body?

391
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,420
All right, then.

392
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,420
Now that you're both here,

393
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,120
let's get started.

394
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,580
Man, around 1.8 meters tall.

395
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,229
There's a bruise on his forehead.

396
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,230
Can you squat a bit?

397
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,920
Squat a bit, or I can't see clearly.

398
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,370
Just do it.

399
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:25,710
Now that you agree to be the examination body, you should cooperate.

400
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,050
It was hit by something hard.

401
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,679
No medicine has been applied yet.

402
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,830
He was possibly hurt last night.

403
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:42,820
Besides blood stasis, there're slight scratches.

404
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:47,310
I think he was hit

405
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:51,700
by a flat and roughly polished weapon, made of hardwood.

406
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,090
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

407
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,919
There's a bruise as wide as a palm on the back of your left hand.

408
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,639
It was pressed by something heavy.

409
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,990
I guess

410
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,229
someone stepped on your hand.

411
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,830
A man.

412
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,349
You injured the end of your palms

413
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,580
by putting them against a smooth hard thing.

414
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,640
You nearly got the wounds at the same time.

415
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,370
Go away.

416
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:24,190
All right. Take off your clothes.

417
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,850
Go on.

418
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,949
No.

419
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,309
You were right.

420
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,469
You guessed right, too.

421
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,180
I've got a bruise on my tailbone.

422
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,829
But you don't need to check that.

423
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,229
You can stop now.

424
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,660
No way!

425
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,309
This isn't over yet.

426
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,559
I can't even fill half of the sheet.

427
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,580
If I stop now, I won't get a good score.

428
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,600
You're the examination body.

429
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,920
You can't decide if I continue or not.

430
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,040
If you don't want to take off your clothes, let me help you.

431
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,940
What does she want to do?

432
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,900
What does he want to do?

433
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,930
- What does she want to do?
- What does she want to do?

434
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,790
When did I say I was the examination body?

435
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:20,420
You said that outside the room.

436
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,970
I did?

437
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:25,370
No. No.

438
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,229
You said that!

439
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,180
I only said you could start the test.

440
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,780
Jing Yi.

441
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,000
Yes, Your Highness. What do you want?

442
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,950
Sorry for the offense. Please forgive me, Your Highness.

443
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,780
Your... Your Highness?

444
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:53,580
You... you're the Commandery Prince An, Small Goldfish?

445
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,919
Shut up! Don't talk nonsense!

446
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,830
Salute to His Highness and say sorry!

447
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:03,690
Are you superior to a prefect?

448
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,790
What do you think you're doing?

449
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,919
I never met such an important official before.

450
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,679
But I met a prefect.

451
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,679
When the Prefect of Qianzhou visited our town,

452
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,799
our magistrate taught us

453
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,000
that when we met the Prefect, we should knee and kowtow.

454
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,069
I kowtowed once to him.

455
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:30,130
Now that you're superior, I kowtowed a few more times.

456
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,640
Is that enough?

457
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,279
Master, it was so wise of you!

458
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,919
His Majesty appreciates Xiao Jinyu for his justness.

459
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,300
How were you sure that he would defend me today?

460
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,109
Han Ji is the Minister of Justice,

461
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,559
but he has to take orders from Xiao Jinyu.

462
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,679
He can't be feeling good.

463
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,759
When he knows Xiao Jinyu used Yan Ming's corpse for the test,

464
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,010
he would certainly impeach him.

465
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:04,679
Those who Xiao Jinyu has offended are happy to help, too.

466
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,590
Xiao Jinyu was punished to repent.

467
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:09,970
Today, it was also possible

468
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:15,010
even if I wanted him to be flogged 50 times too.

469
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,309
Xiao Jinyu is known to be smart.

470
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:23,460
As far as I see, you're much smarter.

471
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:29,070
Not to mention Xiao Jinyu, even if his father were still alive...

472
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,879
I'm sorry.

473
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,950
Don't get angry, Master.

474
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,850
His Majesty mentioned it today.

475
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:43,230
Xiao Heng ran away! After him!

476
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,750
Be quick!

477
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:55,640
If Xiao Heng were still alive, we would be dead!

478
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,559
Yes.

479
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,519
Think more and talk less.

480
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,590
Or you can't survive!

481
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,090
Yes.

482
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,450
Greetings, Eunuch Qin.

483
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,000
General Zhou, may I have a word with you?

484
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,500
[Zhou Han, Commandant of Shen Army]

485
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:23,900
Find an excuse and check what happened in Three Judicial Chief Ministries.

486
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,500
Yes.

487
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,740
Your Highness, the previous exams are over.

488
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,580
Check carefully

489
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,180
if there's any wrong information on the sheet.

490
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,189
[Exam sheet, Chu Chu, female]

491
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,020
I filled it myself. Nothing is wrong.

492
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,520
You came from Pingle Town, Guanling County, Qianzhou?

493
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:00,730
You're from an official family and a literary family.

494
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,349
And all your families are loyal?

495
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,060
Yes.

496
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,260
Nonsense!

497
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,679
You're obviously from a coroner family.

498
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,399
Your grandfather is still alive.

499
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,309
Your father doesn't have any brother, but you have one.

500
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,040
Your brother even has a dog.

501
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,709
How do you even know that?

502
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:20,559
You wear big clothes and they're nearly new.

503
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,760
They are altered, but not tailored.

504
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,850
It means you borrowed them.

505
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:29,780
On your wristbands and hems, there're old and new dog scratches.

506
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,799
Considering your age, they can't be your father's.

507
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,700
They're very likely to be your brother's.

508
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,270
He can even see that?

509
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,109
There's the smell of honey locust and atractylodes on your clothes.

510
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,540
Now, the fact that you wash clothes with them,

511
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,660
it means the clothes belong to someone who is a coroner, too.

512
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,730
He's awesome!

513
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,800
Coroner is usually a family job.

514
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,520
As far as I see in your autopsy,

515
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,229
you're quite proficient in some unpopular skills.

516
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,470
Such skills have a conflict with the Great Tang Laws.

517
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,349
They weren't invented in recent years.

518
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,069
You know such skills.

519
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:08,529
It means your ancestors were coroners before the reign of Emperor Taizong.

520
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:11,210
You're right about everything!

521
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,970
You look handsome,

522
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:20,540
sound perspicacious and take care of criminal cases.

523
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,829
You... you're Handsome Judge?

524
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,949
Handsome Judge?

525
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,820
The chief of Six Gates!

526
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,210
Chief of Six Gates?

527
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,309
He's untraceable.

528
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:37,030
It's always hard to trace him down.

529
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,780
Nine Constables all take his orders.

530
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:43,850
He's the Chief of Six Gates, taking care of all criminal cases,

531
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:47,799
known as Handsome Judge.

532
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,970
A constable with great martial arts

533
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:53,940
follows him, named ﻿Soul-chasing Sword.

534
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,069
I've never heard of him.

535
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,010
I'm not Handsome Judge, either.

536
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,780
You've been mistaken.

537
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,519
But... You're as awesome as him.

538
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,160
Stop talking nonsense.

539
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,189
Now that I'm right about everything, you admit that

540
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,999
you filled in fake information on the exam sheet

541
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,429
and lied about your family background?

542
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,999
But I told the truth.

543
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,040
My families are coroners for generations and work in Yamen.

544
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,679
Aren't we consider an official family?

545
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,919
My family can also read.

546
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,879
We have a lot of books.

547
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,040
Aren't we a literary family?

548
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,919
Also, we're good people who have done nothing bad.

549
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,300
Aren't we loyal?

550
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,200
Kind of.

551
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,250
I heard what you said during the autopsy.

552
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:49,030
I want you to explain more about something.

553
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:53,660
When you checked the dead man who was stabbed by a sharp object,

554
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:57,110
you said he knew the murderer and the murderer knew him, too.

555
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:00,919
Do you mean they're acquainted?

556
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,679
Yes, you're right.

557
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,940
How did you know that?

558
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,060
I...

559
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,559
I'm afraid I can't explain clearly.

560
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,229
Can I gesture?

561
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,730
Yes.

562
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,040
Judged from his wound,

563
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,830
when he was killed, he was facing the murderer.

564
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:28,430
Just like... this.

565
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,250
What are you doing?

566
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,039
I'm trying to show you.

567
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,540
Wu Jiang.

568
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,920
He was offensive.

569
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,060
I apologize on his behalf.

570
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,070
It doesn't matter.

571
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,510
I... I was offensive, too.

572
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,880
Even if this was how he died,

573
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,430
why did it mean he knew the murderer?

574
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,420
If he didn't know the murderer,

575
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,820
he would have reacted just like he did.

576
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,610
As long as he had struggled,

577
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:16,130
he wouldn't have had such a smooth wound.

578
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,970
The brush is simply 20cm long.

579
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,469
But the weapon was a meter long.

580
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,879
He had much more time to respond.

581
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,189
However strong the murderer was,

582
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,429
he could have time to seize the weapon

583
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,610
when he was stabbed.

584
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,279
But within such a long time, he didn't struggle at all.

585
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,310
It means he never expected that man to kill him.

586
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:38,330
He didn't want to believe that even when he was dying.

587
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,940
You know clearly what a dead man thinks.

588
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,349
Of course.

589
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,109
Dead men are different from living people.

590
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,679
You can learn from their corpse

591
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,010
about their thought and what they did before death.

592
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,349
It's much easier to understand them than living people.

593
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,270
What else can you see from his corpse?

594
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,930
One more thing.

595
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:04,799
But I haven't seen where he was killed.

596
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,110
I can't talk without evidence.

597
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,880
I can show you the place.

598
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,190
Do you want to handle this for me?

599
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,540
Yes. Of course!

600
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,999
[Two Merits Hall]

601
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,050
- Your Highness.
- You really don't know Six Gates?

602
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:22,710
It's a wonderful place. There're even female constables.

603
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:26,760
I thought Six Gates was the only place where women could work.

604
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,879
You're sure she wasn't lying?

605
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,949
Why do I think she keeps talking nonsense?

606
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:35,590
I work for His Highness by judging if someone's lying.

607
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:39,540
Even if you don't trust me, you should trust my ancestral skill.

608
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,560
I hear you got her back from the street.

609
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,999
Yes.

610
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,420
What do you mean got her back?

611
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,919
I did that for the sake of her fate with His Highness.

612
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,280
See? His Highness noticed her.

613
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,350
I'm serious.
[Three Judicial Chief Ministries]

614
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,829
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Who are you?

615
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,120
You may rise.

616
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,570
I'm a waiter at Fusheng Inn.

617
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,000
The girl...

618
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,759
It's already bad luck when a female coroner like her lives in our inn.

619
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,620
She even ran away without paying the bill!

620
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,940
She left a stone pendant,

621
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,599
saying she would take the exam here

622
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,519
- Why does she have the pendant?
- and would buy the pendant back afterward.

623
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,840
Who exactly is she?

624
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,869
I think she simply wants to repudiate the bill!

625
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,869
No, no.

626
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,429
I didn't mean that!

627
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,980
When I woke up this morning, I found my purse missing.

628
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,559
I was in a hurry for the exam.

629
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,910
Then I left the pendant as a pledge

630
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,469
and left a note on the table.

631
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,669
I even put my thumbprint on it.

632
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,950
As soon as I make money, I'll go pay the bill

633
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:36,040
and buy back my pendant.

634
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,519
Buy back such a useless stone.

635
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,050
Who are you trying to fool?

636
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,150
It's not a useless stone!

637
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,709
- You're obviously trying to repudiate the bill!
- I'm not!

638
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:46,840
How much does she owe you?

639
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,229
Please understand, Your Highness.

640
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,290
Taking accommodation, lamp-oil, and candle into consideration,

641
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,940
the bill is 37 copper coins.

642
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,570
I'm telling the truth!

643
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,170
Jing Yi.

644
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,220
Thank you. Thank you.

645
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,759
Your Highness, there's another bill.

646
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,280
- She's a coroner...
- How dare you to push it!

647
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,040
- Sir...
- What sir? Vice Minister!

648
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,999
Vice Minister, think about it.

649
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,629
If it were you,

650
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,759
would you like to sleep on a bed a coroner once slept on

651
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,710
or use the tableware she used?

652
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,410
I would.

653
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:31,229
Wu Jiang, go back with him and tell the manager of the inn that

654
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:34,280
I'll rent the room Miss Chu lived in for a long term.

655
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,100
No one shall change anything in that room.

656
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,480
- I'll go live there whenever I'm free.
- Yes.

657
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,780
I'll see what an inn it is

658
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,870
that even a waiter can bully a customer in my place.

659
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,950
Don't get angry, Your Highness!

660
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,119
I don't mean that.

661
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,839
I won't ask for the money. I won't!

662
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,119
- I'm leaving, Your Highness.
- Come back. Her pendant!

663
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,190
And the note she wrote.

664
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,389
Go!

665
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:15,740
Spare me, Official!

666
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,519
I won't do that again, Official!

667
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,390
Thank you, Your Highness.

668
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:22,110
I paid.

669
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,909
Thank you, too, Lord Jing.

670
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,839
When I make money, I'll pay you back.

671
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,640
Don't bother.
