00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,810
When there was a fire in the archive of the Guanling Yamen,

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,219
between the shifts of two magistrates,

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,599
the Xu family moved away and disappeared.
[Unknown]

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,820
It was such a coincidence.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,019
Someone tried to cover something up.
[Xu's Tomb]

7
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:20,500
Sir Witch Doctor left a letter to me and left home.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,040
Where has he gone?

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,340
Why did he hide an end-game in his room?
[Knight, Elephant, Pawn]

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,010
There're so many secrets.

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,260
I will figure everything out.

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,320
Do you mean she not only hurt her forehead when hitting the wall but also wounded the back of her head?

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,040
No. She didn't hit the wall.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,370
She was hit by something blunt intensively.

15
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,090
You mean...?

16
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:04,830
Your Highness, there're fractures in her carpal bones, ulnas, and radii.

17
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,420
She was wounded before she died.

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,020
How was she wounded?

19
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,010
- To protect me.
- Protect you?

20
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,930
I was nearly born when she was hurt.

21
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,239
She had a swollen belly.

22
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,989
Someone suddenly pushed her from behind,

23
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,020
trying to make it an accident that she hit the wall herself.

24
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,889
To protect me in her body,

25
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,869
she held her arms against the wall immediately.

26
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,340
Because of the fierce hitting, she had fractures of different levels

27
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,060
in her carpal bones, ulnas, and radii.
[Multiple fractures]

28
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,879
Failing in killing her, the murderer hit the back of her head again,

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,440
and then she died of the fracture in her occipital.

30
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,379
Your Highness, my mother didn't kill herself.

31
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,709
She was killed by others!

32
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,959
Please redress the grievance for her.

33
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,560
Stand up.

34
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,349
Not to mention she's your mother, even if she's an irrelevant woman,

35
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:07,800
- I'll also find out the truth and redress the grievance for her.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

36
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,900
Okay. You're the coroner, taking care of the case.

37
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,720
Don't do this.

38
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,770
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,569
Your Highness, I know how to find my father.

40
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,680
How?

41
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,019
Do you remember I told you that

42
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,709
a human's appearance had something to do with his skull?

43
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,110
Yes.

44
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,879
With my mother's skull for reference, I can restore her appearance with pottery clay.

45
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,349
Then you can draw a portrait of her.

46
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,660
If someone can recognize her, he might also know my father.

47
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,170
Restore her appearance with clay?

48
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,679
Just like a statue.

49
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,879
It'll look more real with clay.

50
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,429
Sounds like a good idea.

51
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,860
But Chu Chu, she's your mother.

52
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,090
Have you made up your mind?

53
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,170
Your Highness, it's something about my mother's grievance.

54
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,119
As you said, even if she's an irrelevant woman,

55
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,189
we'll also find out the truth, not to mention she's my mother.

56
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,979
She had risked her life to protect me before she died.

57
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:08,450
As a coroner, I should do everything I can to speak for the dead.

58
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,730
Please let me do it.

59
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,170
All right. You can do it.

60
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,140
Let's do it your way.

61
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,780
Thank you, Your Highness.

62
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,220
Who is there?

[Jing Mansion]

67
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,390
Master, a letter from Young Master.

68
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,140
[Dear Father,]  [From Jing Yi]

69
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,910
Master, is there anything wrong with Young Master?

70
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,480
Commandery Prince An found a eunuch's corpse in the house

71
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,299
where Xiao Heng used to live.

72
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,899
A eunuch's corpse?

73
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,750
Why was a eunuch in Qianzhou?

74
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,089
Qin Luan went to Qianzhou, to pacify the rebellion of Chen Ying.

75
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:32,719
Later, eunuchs went there to exterminate the remnants.

76
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,869
I guess that was when the eunuch went there.

77
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:41,519
Commandery Prince An asserted that Xiao Heng killed the eunuch.

78
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,309
Prince Consort killed a eunuch?

79
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,520
It doesn't sound right.

80
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,189
Prince Consort was almost killed by rebels.

81
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,799
The eunuchs exterminated rebels.

82
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,279
Speaking of this, Prince Consort and the eunuchs

83
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,370
should be on the same side.

84
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,870
It's true that the eunuchs exterminated rebels.

85
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,819
But Xiao Heng never went on well with the eunuchs.

86
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:03,100
When he worked in the court, he often punished the eunuchs.

87
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:10,449
It's also possible that they took the chance to kill Xiao Heng.

88
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,590
You make sense, Master.

89
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,999
According to this, Xiao Heng is likely to be alive.

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,390
As reported, Princess Xiping just visited His Majesty.

91
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,630
Now, she may go to the Xue Mansion.

92
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,019
Keep a close eye on the Xue Mansion.

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,180
[Xue Mansion]

00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,380

00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,410
Banxia, keep guard at the door.

96
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,910
Yes.

97
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,890
This way, please, Your Grace.

98
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,780
Mr. Xue, please save my son and me!

99
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,110
What are you doing, Your Grace?

100
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,600
If you want me to do anything, I'll do it, regardless of any danger.

101
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,600
You're the princess. Don't kneel to me.

102
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,030
Your Grace, be seated and tell me.

103
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,170
Don't cry, Your Grace. Or your eyes might get hurt.

104
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,110
Your Grace, you visited His Majesty?

105
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,719
If I guess correctly, His Majesty told you about the marriage

106
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,020
between General Xiao and Miss Leng Yue.

107
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,769
You knew that?

108
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,100
I heard about it.

109
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,590
I treat you as my family and I always tell you everything.

110
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,150
Why did you keep it from me?

111
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,000
I...

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,389
Your Grace, you watched Leng Yue grow up.

113
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:04,099
You also wanted Commandery Prince An to marry her.

114
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,330
Why don't you allow General Xiao to marry her?

115
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,500
Are you trying to placate me?

116
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,739
I'm not an ignorant woman.

117
00:07:12,739 --> 00:07:16,919
I'm one of the imperial family, and I grew up in the palace.

118
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:22,540
Leng Yue is the only granddaughter of Leng Peishan, Military Commissioner of Qianzhongdao.

119
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,529
His Majesty is feeding my son to the wolves!

120
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:32,020
Now that you know the real problem, I'll get to the point.

121
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,339
General Leng is your uncle.

122
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:36,870
He's also the head of the Leng family.

123
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,339
It concerns his family's interests.

124
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,610
If General Xiao forcibly takes over the military power in the Southwest,

125
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,370
I'm afraid he'll be in danger.

126
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,190
If Jinli takes over the military power in the Southwest,

127
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:54,400
he and I will go the same old way like my mother did,

128
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,960
becoming chess pieces to restrain the Leng family in the Southwest.

129
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,900
Your Grace, may I ask how you replied to His Majesty?

130
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,470
I'm no longer a young girl.

131
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,620
I didn't lose my temper in front of His Majesty.

132
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,060
His Majesty promised me that I could divine their birthdays

133
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,860
before he gives the order about the marriage.

134
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,000
I can only stall him for a short time.

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,740
Sir, please do something for me.

136
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,570
I... I know.

137
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:33,320
You're Senior Jing's disciple and you don't want to disobey him.

138
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,039
If you worry about your future, please tell me directly.

139
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,609
It's human nature.

140
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,620
I won't blame you for it.

141
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,879
Your Grace, I watched General Xiao and Commandery Prince An grow up.

142
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,100
To be honest, I've been thinking about it so far.

143
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:59,439
If you trust me, I'll try to solve the problem for you.

144
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,060
What's the plan, Mr. Xue?

145
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,570
I'm going to the Southwest.

146
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,430
Your Highness?

147
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,289
What brings you here?

148
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:22,829
I'm looking for Jing Yi. Where's he?

149
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,939
I didn't see him when I woke up.

150
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,300
Maybe he's still sleeping.

151
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,560
Your Highness, I've got something to tell you.

152
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,740
May I have a word with you?

153
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:53,509
Your Highness, I know I may sound ungrateful,

154
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,349
but I must make something clear

155
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,490
or it'll hurt us both.

156
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,439
Just get to the point.

157
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,850
We grew up together.

158
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,899
I admire you for your morality and ability, so I always obey you.

159
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,700
But...

160
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:11,170
I only treat you as my good friend.

161
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,480
So do I.

162
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,029
That's fine, then.

163
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,630
Wait.

164
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,850
Be specific.

165
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,629
I hear that Aunt wants us to get married.

166
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,129
I don't know if you have agreed.

167
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,919
I want to make it clear to you.

168
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,029
But it's fine now.

169
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,379
From now on, let's still be good friends.

170
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,349
I'll still obey you.

171
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,429
Leng Yue, I don't know how you heard of that.

172
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,359
My mother never told me about it.

173
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,610
I respect you for being straightforward,

174
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,890
ebullient, and as brave as men.

175
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,129
But as you said, I only treat you as my good friend.

176
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,840
Also, we're cousins.

177
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,560
I never meant to love you.

178
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,229
I obey imperial rules and live my life.

179
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,870
You enjoy yourself in the martial world.

180
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,290
If you're forced to stay in Three Judicial Offices,

181
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,920
there'll always be a mess until we fight against each other

182
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,589
and both suffer great losses.

183
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,030
Yes, you're right.

184
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,410
Now that we made it clear, I have something to ask you.

185
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,240
- Go ahead.
- You never wanted to come to Qianzhou.

186
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,679
But you insisted on coming with me this time.

187
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,480
Why?

188
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,240
Aunt asked me to come with you.

189
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,559
No one can ever control you.

190
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,900
I can figure it out.

191
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,299
My mother must have asked you to keep an eye on Chu Chu

192
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,119
in case she might hurt me.

193
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,359
But you wouldn't be convinced to come or risk your life to save her.

194
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,260
So, why did you come?

195
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,270
I know I can hide no secret from you.

196
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,780
- I did come for Chu Chu.
- Chu Chu?

197
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,040
Yes. For her.

198
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:56,770
Because... she's... like me.

199
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,030
Who's talking out there?

200
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,960
Your Highness?

201
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,930
What are you talking about?

202
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,639
Chu Chu is working in the mortuary.

203
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,259
Yamen runners can't keep her company.

204
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,169
Go send her some pottery clay and stay with her,

205
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,069
in case she imagines things.

206
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,570
All right.

207
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,059
Go guard the door and keep everyone away.

208
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,560
Yes.

209
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,070
Your Highness, you look so serious.

210
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,220
Insiders know you come to talk with me.

211
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,949
Ignorant people will think you're coming to date a girl.

212
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:49,269
Are you looking for trouble simply because I haven't punished you for days?

213
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:53,270
I'm too exhausted to make trouble.

214
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,140
Who?

215
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,349
Didn't you just get up?

216
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,209
Why are your shoes muddy?

217
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,170
Who told you I just got up?

218
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,149
I woke up really early, went around the county,

219
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,960
and checked about local copper coins.

220
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,709
Then I came back to bed.

221
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,030
But just a while later, you came.

222
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,349
I do come to see you for some girl's stuff.

223
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,519
Girl? Which girl?

224
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,320
Tell me about it.

225
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,349
A girl from the Xu family.

226
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,800
The Xu family?

227
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,020
They don't look like a girl's stuff.

228
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,170
They're jewels and clothes of a woman.

229
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,170
Why don't they look like a girl's stuff?

230
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:52,250
I mean they belong to a married woman, instead of a young girl.

231
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,950
Also, they look old-fashioned.

232
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,920
Chu Chu.

233
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,410
Miss Leng?

234
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,249
His Highness said you were doing something important in this place

235
00:14:05,249 --> 00:14:07,790
and asked me to bring you some clay.

236
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,920
You need this for an autopsy?

237
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,669
It's not for an autopsy.

238
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:15,020
It's for...

239
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,370
restoring my mother's face.

240
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,080
Your mother?

241
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,659
His Highness and I opened my mother's coffin.

242
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,360
I'll use the clay to restore her appearance.

243
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,739
When it's done, we may find someone who knows her

244
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,400
and confirm her identity.

245
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,679
No wonder His Highness worries when you stay here alone.

246
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,959
He worries?

247
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,099
No. No, I don't mean that.

248
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:48,050
I mean he worries you'll imagine things when you stay here alone.

249
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,609
Miss Leng, don't worry.

250
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:54,089
I promised His Highness that I would treat my mother

251
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,339
in the way I would treat other corpses.

252
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:01,940
I won't think about anything else, except restoring her appearance.

253
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:07,169
Speaking of that, when I learned medical skills, I noticed that

254
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:10,929
a person's skull had something to do with his appearance.

255
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:15,800
But whether the person is fat or thin also plays an important role.

256
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,149
Luckily, we found a set of my mother's clothes,

257
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,439
which was buried with her in the coffin.

258
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,209
Based on the clothes, I can figure out her shape.

259
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:28,460
When I finish this, I'll know

260
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,760
what my mother looks like.

261
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,049
Your Highness, where did you get them?

262
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,199
They belong to Chu Chu's mother.

263
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,630
Chu Chu's mother? Lady Xu?

264
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,199
She's been dead for many years.

265
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,240
How did you get..?

266
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,720
From her coffin?

267
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,690
Your Highness, you went too far!

268
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,050
It's all right when you checked who Chu Chu was,

269
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,370
but you shouldn't have opened her mother's coffin!

270
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,519
Chu Chu allowed me to do that.

271
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,639
She was there when the coffin was opened.

272
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,590
She opened her mother's coffin?

273
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,679
She has inspected her mother's skeleton.

274
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,289
Now, she's trying to restore her mother's appearance in the mortuary,

275
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,280
so as to provide more clues for her mother's identity.

276
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,849
Chu Chu has seen all kinds of corpses as a coroner,

277
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,269
but opening her mother's coffin and checking her mother's skeleton?

278
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,319
It's hard for anyone, Your Highness.

279
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,029
That's why we must check every single clue very carefully

280
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,219
and not waste her bravery.

281
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,469
You're familiar with girls' stuff.

282
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,879
Check them carefully and see what information you can find.

283
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,449
What do you want me to find?

284
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,999
If I tell you now, I'll influence your judgment.

285
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,559
Check them first.

286
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,149
I'll go see Chu Chu in the mortuary.

287
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,650
All right.

288
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,109
Speaking of it, I don't remember what my mother looks like.

289
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,079
When I was very little, my parents died, too.

290
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,880
Princess Xiping brought me up.

291
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,980
Princess Xiping?

292
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,060
Why did she bring you up?

293
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:10,079
Your parents died early, but you have a grandfather, don't you?

294
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,559
Didn't I tell you?

295
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:14,740
His Highness's mother, Princess Xiping, is my aunt.

296
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,179
When my parents died, my family was in a mess.

297
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:21,150
My aunt brought me to her house and looked after me.

298
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,839
But my grandfather?

299
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,879
He didn't come back to Chang'an until years after my parents died.

300
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,170
He was summoned to meet the new emperor.

301
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:33,650
If I had waited for him, I might have been dead.

302
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,899
I'm simply complaining. Don't take it seriously.

303
00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:40,479
Don't tell His Highness or Xiao Jinli.

304
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,529
They always want to patch things up between my grandfather and me,

305
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,069
especially Xiao Jinli.

306
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,559
If he knew, he'd be nagging me again.

307
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,449
I see. Don't worry. I won't tell anyone about it.

308
00:17:52,449 --> 00:17:55,599
Miss Leng, don't be too sad.

309
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,729
I think when you look into the mirror,

310
00:17:57,729 --> 00:17:59,890
you'll know what your parents look like.

311
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,289
Look into the mirror?

312
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,279
Yeah.

313
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,490
People think we're born to be different.

314
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:08,609
It's not right. We look like our parents.

315
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:11,890
I'm serious. I studied it very carefully.

316
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,919
One doesn't have a face out of nowhere.
[Father, Mother] [Appearance inheritance]

317
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:16,859
He looks like his parents.

318
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:23,010
For example, if a couple doesn't have tall noses, their child

319
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,430
will hardly have a tall nose.

320
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:30,219
And the eyes... If the couple have a single eyelid, their child

321
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,299
won't have double eyelids as I do.

322
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,429
[Single eyelid, Double eyelids]

323
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,799
Sounds interesting.

324
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,729
I haven't noticed that before.

325
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,519
I don't know what your parents look like.

326
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,039
But you look so beautiful.

327
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,140
It's not only because of your father.

328
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,919
Thank you, Chu Chu.

329
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,409
You're welcome.

330
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,340
I'm telling the truth.

331
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,349
Do you know why I came to Qianzhou?

332
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,679
You told me about that.

333
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,460
Princess Xiping sent you.

334
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,039
Before I went back to Chang'an, I had heard about you.

335
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,399
At first, I thought you got close to His Highness for a purpose.

336
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,759
But after I met you in Chang'an, I knew I misunderstood you.

337
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,999
I met all kinds of people in the martial world.

338
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,969
The first time I saw you,

339
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:26,990
I knew you and I were the same kind of person.

340
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,829
I'm a coroner.

341
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,709
You're from a rich family.

342
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,639
We're totally different.

343
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,900
How can we be the same kind?

344
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,680
I don't mean family background,

345
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,070
but what we pursue.

346
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,519
What we pursue?

347
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,829
You went all the way to Chang'an, just like I ran away from Chang'an.

348
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,399
We pursue what we want.

349
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,429
You want a chance to be a coroner.

350
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,459
All I want is to be freed from the clan.

351
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,179
There aren't many chances for girls.

352
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,920
When I see you trying hard to be a coroner,

353
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,300
I kind of see the old me.

354
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:16,279
So, I promised my aunt to come to Qianzhou with you

355
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,250
so that I could help you realize your dream.

356
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,470
Now, His Highness has finally hired you.

357
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,609
Congratulations. You'll be an official coroner in Three Judicial Offices.

358
00:20:26,609 --> 00:20:29,510
Thank you, Miss Leng.

359
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,179
What for?

360
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:35,109
I'm just an idler who is quite self-sentimental.

361
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:38,340
You should say thank you to His Highness.

362
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,130
Forget it.

363
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,079
Who do you think is the most handsome,

364
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:46,159
His Highness, Jing Yi, or Xiao Jinli?

365
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,540
They all look handsome.

366
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,709
But in different ways.

367
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,830
Be specific.

368
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,879
Vice Minister Jing has a pretty face.

369
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,129
General Xiao has a strong body.

370
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:02,130
His Highness...

371
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,309
You know what?

372
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,330
I'm sure his skull looks great.

373
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,069
I'm right about you.

374
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,260
You're indeed a good coroner.

375
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,769
His Highness looks handsome.

376
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:21,840
But I always think he shouldn't look like this.

377
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,189
Why?

378
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:28,799
Is General Xiao's biological brother of the same parents?

379
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,179
Yeah. They're twins.

380
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:34,759
Some twins look different.

381
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,530
It's not weird, isn't it?

382
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,899
It's not weird when twins look different.

383
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,280
But as I said,

384
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,399
I can infer the child's appearance from his parent's skulls.

385
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,109
It's not perfectly correct, but based on their appearances,

386
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:57,459
they don't look like brothers of the same parents.

387
00:21:57,459 --> 00:21:59,449
Don't let Xiao Jinli hear you.

388
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,979
You see how hard he protects His Highness.

389
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,630
If he heard you, he'd punch you!

390
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,589
As far as I see, one of them may look like their father

391
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,279
while the other looks like their mother.

392
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,949
Or maybe His Highness decided a lot before he was born.

393
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,560
You know what? His Highness has been making his own decisions since he was little.

394
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,589
Maybe when he wanted to look like this, he then had the face.

395
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,610
He has good taste, then?

396
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,510
Your Highness!

397
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,850
Your Highness.

398
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,949
How's the clay statue going?

399
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,279
It's done.

400
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,779
It's my first time doing this.

401
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:39,039
I may have done a poor job.

402
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,440
But the crude face won't be wrong.

403
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,789
Well done.

404
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,209
Leave the rest to me.

405
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,929
You had a long day. Go back for some rest.

406
00:22:56,929 --> 00:23:00,159
When I find any clue, I'll tell you personally.

407
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,619
Thank you, Your Highness.

408
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,739
Leng Yue, walk her back.

409
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,259
All right. Let's go.

Eunuch Qin.

412
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,009
You, leave!

413
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:50,510
Yes.

414
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:18,280
Do you know why you can stay?

415
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,290
He's asking you. Say something!

416
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,609
He's dead?

417
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:36,540
Yeah. I think he took some poison.

418
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,809
Aconitine.

419
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:46,079
He's really from the Southwest.

420
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,799
How daring!

421
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:51,170
He even dared to make trouble here.

422
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,470
He thought I was totally ignorant?

423
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,329
It's not your place to stir up trouble.

424
00:25:00,329 --> 00:25:02,800
Master, who do you mean?

425
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:09,330
Are you sure he's the man who spread the rumors about Duke Chang?

426
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:12,150
Absolutely sure!

427
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,039
We came unexpectedly and he killed himself hastily.

428
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:30,929
There must be some clues that haven't been destroyed yet.

429
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,899
Search this room carefully.

430
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:34,400
Yes.

431
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,410

You are flattering me, Eunuch Qin.

458

When he brought this here, did he say something?

459
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,679
He simply asked me to repair this.

460
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,320
He said nothing else.

Look. Even you hold the Book of Songs.

but he does much better than me.

535
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:43,699
Considering his Swift Moving, when he deliberately sneaks

536
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,939
about ten meters away from you, can you notice him?

537
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,519
He has poor martial arts.

538
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,489
If I pay attention, I'll notice him.

539
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:55,309
But I may not if I'm not paying attention.

540
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,610
- Why do you suddenly ask?
- Nothing.

541
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,469
Your Highness!

542
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,559
Your Highness, bad news!

543
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,470
Chu Chu was kidnapped!

544
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,050
What? When? Where?

545
00:33:05,051 --> 00:33:06,879
Just now. Less than a quarter of an hour.

546
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,119
At the fair near the Yamen.

547
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,449
When I was buying something,

548
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,279
that man knocked her out and took her away!

549
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,179
It was my fault. I was too careless.

550
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:14,239
Did you see him clearly?

551
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,409
A middle-aged man with medium height.

552
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,609
I think I met him before.

553
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:19,420
- He was alone?
- Yes.

554
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,899
Then, you let him run away?

555
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,089
I...

556
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,129
Jinyu, I'll go assemble the soldiers.

557
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:26,769
Leng Yue, go borrow some men from Zheng Youde.

558
00:33:26,769 --> 00:33:28,140
Also, bring Deputy Magistrate Tan Gui.

559
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,260
He's a native. He's more familiar with the local conditions.

560
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,760
All right.

561
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,210
Be quick!

562
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,179
Be quick!

563
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,759
Your Highness, here it is.

564
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,509
After he caught Chu Chu, he ran down the lane.

565
00:33:42,509 --> 00:33:45,499
- I was a bit late and they were gone.
- Over there!

566
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:48,189
What kind of people live nearby?

567
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:51,309
Your Highness, common people live nearby.

568
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,999
Most of them do small businesses.

569
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,329
If I remember correctly, no one has a criminal record.

570
00:33:56,329 --> 00:33:57,459
Precisely.

571
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:01,369
Leng Yue, you said when you caught up, a carriage passed by

572
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,949
- and stopped you so that you failed in catching up.
- Yes.

573
00:34:03,949 --> 00:34:06,419
- Where?
- Right here.

574
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,200
Here, Your Highness.

575
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,610
Tracks of the carriage?

576
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,800
The carriage was parked there.

577
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,370
Chu Chu sat there.

578
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,939
That man knew Leng Yue was responsive and had good martial arts.

579
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:27,509
He asked the carriage to stop her.

580
00:34:27,509 --> 00:34:29,110
Chu Chu!

581
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,240
He met Leng Yue before.

582
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,180
- Chu Chu!
- And he knew what she could do.

583
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,709
It's Xu Rugui!

584
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,310
Jinyu!

585
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,660
Is this Miss Chu's hairpin?

586
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,849
Where did you find it?

587
00:34:45,849 --> 00:34:49,359
- Under the basket.
- Under the basket?

588
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,470
Chu Chu can't have dropped it.

589
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,709
Xu Rugui asked his man to stop Leng Yue.

590
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,319
He knocked Chu Chu out and took her away.

591
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,450
In such a short time, he dropped the hairpin under the basket.

592
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,489
- He did it on purpose!
- Who did it?

593
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:11,639
Xu Rugui.

594
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,649
Brother, keep searching this place with your men.

595
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,279
Have two runners stay and help.

596
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,469
Let the rest of them go back to the Yamen.

597
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,970
All right.

598
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:22,530
Does it have something to do with Jing Yi?

599
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,569
Who... Who are you?

600
00:35:42,569 --> 00:35:45,600
I think I met you before.

601
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,739
Where am I?

602
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:52,739
I'm warning you! I work for the Yamen.

603
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:54,189
Commandery Prince An, you know?

604
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,529
I'm a coroner working for him.

605
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:56,949
He'll come and find me!

606
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:00,229
I'm sure he'll come, Chu Chu.

607
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,639
You know my name?

608
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:04,709
You know my name, too.

609
00:36:04,709 --> 00:36:06,839
But everything was in a mess that day.

610
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:09,609
You may not remember my face.

611
00:36:09,609 --> 00:36:15,330
Or you may have only remembered another image of mine in Rugui House.

612
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,230
You... You are...?

613
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,050
I'm Xu Rugui.
