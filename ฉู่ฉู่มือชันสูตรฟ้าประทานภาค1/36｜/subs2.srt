and assigned Zhou Han to case the joint at the Xiao family's Ancestral Hall.

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,400
Then he sent Xu Rugui to the Three Judicial Offices.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,190
He went through all these efforts.

They made me eat a ball.

11
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,890
The trick must lie in what Xu Rugui ate.

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,879
You will all die when the time is up.

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,859
Your Highness, Chu Chu...

14
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,560
What happened to Chu Chu?

How's it going?

17
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,780
It's all right. I made it.

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,160
Is this what you took from his stomach?

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,190
What's with this ball?

20
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,570
That's gluten.

21
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,159
The outer layer is mixed with castor bean poison

22
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,389
and the inside is mercury refined with gelsemium elegan.

23
00:01:08,389 --> 00:01:11,680
Your Highness, it's exactly the same as you expected.

24
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,470
Your Highness, what's wrong?

25
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,370
His Majesty is generous.

26
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,220
He allowed you to get married in the palace.

27
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,170
You need to enter the palace today to get prepared for the wedding.

28
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,999
Your family can't come to Chang'an now.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,830
Madam Jing will take care of everything for you.

30
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,080
Just listen to her arrangements.

31
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,040
Leng Yue, please send Chu Chu into the palace.

32
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,470

Don't worry, we will win.

That scum!

35
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,549
It's fine that he set me up.

36
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,670
How dare he use an insidious trick on Chu Chu!

37
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,229
He poisoned Xu Rugui and sent him over as scheduled.

38
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:21,820
He knew you would let Chu Chu examine him.

39
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,550
He knows that if Xu Rugui dies in Three Judicial Offices,

40
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,889
I'll let Chu Chu perform an autopsy on him because I can't trust other people.

41
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:31,850
When Chu Chu cuts open his stomach,

42
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,819
the poisonous gas would diffuse and kill Chu Chu!

43
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,940
Chu Chu, you, and the emperor.

44
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,499
Kill three birds with one stone.

45
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,160
Yes, that's exactly what he wants.

46
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,290
The coroner will burn gleditsia sinensis and atractylodes lancea

47
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,980
before performing an autopsy to drive away evil spirits.

48
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,850
When I come in to check her, I would also be poisoned to death.

49
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,720
According to the rules I set before,

50
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,519
if the deceased died of some unknown disease or poison,

51
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:02,770
to avoid others from being harmed,

52
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,559
the deceased can't be kept in the mansion and must be buried within four hours.

53
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:10,279
If I'm buried, my spirit tablet will be sent to the ancestral hall immediately.

54
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:14,269
In order to appease the royal family members and the examinees gathered in Chang'an,

55
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:17,079
the emperor would go to the Ancestral Hall of the Xiao family in person.

56
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,420
Then his chance will come.

57
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,200
Each step is interlocked. He is malicious and thoughtful indeed.

58
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,799
Fortunately, Chu Chu was bold but careful enough to see through his trick.

59
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:30,029
Your Highness, in such a situation,

60
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:34,150
he will definitely attend your wedding two days later.

61
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,610
Send out the invitations for me.

62
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,470

General Wu, just treat me like a fart and let me go.

68
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,370
Cut it out.

69
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,299

73
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,640
No problem. Can you let me go first?

74
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,190
Let you go?

75
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,460
Come with me.

76
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,069
Grabbing me makes me look bad.

77
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,570
Go.

but I've seen the token on you.

The leader of Zhenyuan Escort also has such a token.

121

It's a token of the leaders of Zhenyuan Escort.

You came all the way back to Chang'an and have changed your clothes several times.

But you still take it with you.

It's enough to prove her importance in your heart.

It's just I still feel guilty about letting her take risks with me.

136
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,280
You two. When we were in Qianzhou, she also told me this.

137
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,570
She was afraid she would get you into trouble.

138
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,180
You two didn't get each other into any trouble.

139

But you did give me a lot of work.

140

It's too hard for me. After this is over, I'd better hurry back.

For real, Jinyu. I've been feeling unsure about it.

142
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,340
At this point, does Xue Rucheng really just count on such a few people

143
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,950
to help him usurp the throne?

144
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,200
No matter what he will do,

as long as he makes a move,

146
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,560
he will make arrangements.

147
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,130
As long as he makes arrangements, there must be traces left.

148
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,450
As long as there are traces, I can find him before he makes another move.

149
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,149
I don't understand the move and arrangement you are talking about.

150
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:43,580
Just tell me what you need me to do.

151
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,160
Go back and accompany Mother.

152
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,580
She didn't say anything, but she must be worried now.

153
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,709
She didn't say anything because she doesn't want to distract me.

154
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,229
You have been away from Chang'an for so long.

155
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,030
She misses you a lot.

156
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,490
Go back and spend more time with her.

159
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,500
I'll let you know if I have any plans.

All right, I'll listen to you.

161
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,239
I will go back now. I'm leaving.

162
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,089
I had been worried about Commandery Prince An's marriage all day long.

163
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:31,690
I didn't expect that they would get married

164
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,550
after a trip to the Southwest.

165
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,119
Looks like young people shouldn't stay in one place all the time.

166

We don't have a daughter.

168
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,329
I never expected I would give a bride away one day.

169
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,589
Let me ask you.

170
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:57,780
What kind of dowry is popular in Chang'an now?

171
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,800
His Majesty is gracious.

172
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,249
He specially allowed Chu Chu to get married in the palace.

173
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:05,959
I have to make sure that the wedding

174
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,639
is good enough for Commandery Prince An.

175
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,940
What do you think?

176
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,840
Forget it.

00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,839
It's the business of women. You know nothing about it.

178
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,850
Why would I ask you?

179
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,099
This is the latest popular color in Jiangnan.
[Wedding]

180
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,339
Look. It looks opulent but unassuming.

181
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:23,890
It's perfect to make

182
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,000
His Highness's wedding rope with it.

183
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,320
It's not good.

184
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,809
This material looks all right on Jinli.

185
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:30,170
But Jinyu is whiter than him.

186
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,390
Let's use the material I have.

187
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,950
Yes.

188
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,100
Mother.

189
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,850
I just got back and you brought me to try these things.

190
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:42,960
You picked and picked.

191
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,369
In the end, you picked the first one you like.

192
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:48,539
You wasted all these efforts and wrapped me up like a zongzi.
(A traditional Chinese rice dish made of glutinous rice stuffed with different fillings and wrapped in bamboo leaves)

193
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:50,059
That's because you won't cooperate.

194
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,620
You keep saying good and no problem when I asked you.

195
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,329
Okay, it's my fault.

196
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:59,530
Listen. No matter what, Jinyu has a wife now.

197
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,880
But look at you.

198
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,979
How is it about me all of a sudden?

199
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:05,640
Of course, it's about you.

200
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,640
You stay in the Southwest Army all the time.

201
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,909
You can't meet any girl and the girl can't meet you either.

202
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:14,489
When can you get married?

203
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:17,249
I mean, Mother. It's Jinyu who will get married.

204
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:18,670
Why are you measuring me?

205
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,130
I need to make you some new clothes.

206
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,049
The emperor finally took back the thought of letting you marry Yue.

207
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:28,409
While you are still in Chang'an, I'll find a good wife for you.

208
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:31,039
Jinyu's wedding will be full of guests.

209
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:35,749
Dress yourself up. Maybe some girl will fall in love with you.

210
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:38,980
Mother, you are making me sound like a cucumber on a vegetable stall.

211
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,100
Will someone want me if I look fresher?

212
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,100
Don't make jokes.

213
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,230
- Aunt.
- Yue.

214
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,450
General Xiao is handsome and talented.

215
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:54,259
He will still be shining even if he wore a sack.

216
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:57,040
Aunt, don't worry about it.

217
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,340
When did you become so sweet?

218
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,470
Shouldn't you be preparing for Chu Chu's dowry?

219
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,830
Why are you here to make trouble?

220
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,979
Who is making trouble? Aunt asked me to come.

221
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,190
All right, you fight every time you meet.

222
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,230
I've forgotten the important thing.

223
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,240
That's because of you.

224
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,020
It's my fault again.

225
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,260
This is the heirloom of the Xiao family.

226
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,030
When I married your father,

227
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,740
your father gave it to me in person.

228
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,900
Yue, give it to Chu Chu.

229
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,129
Shouldn't you give it to Jinyu first and let Jinyu give it to Chu Chu?

230
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:37,910
Here, Yue.

231
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,620
I'll keep this one for you.

232
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,649
When you meet someone you love,

233
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,310
I will give it to her by myself.

234
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,150
All right.

235
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,040
Come on.

236
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,130
It's so pretty.

237
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,070
This is the most beautiful dress I have ever seen.

238
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:11,499
Of course. This was chosen from thousands of materials and styles

239
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:15,179
by the maids in the palace. Madam Jing supervised it in person.

240
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,350
You will be the most beautiful bride in Chang'an.

241
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,900
I heard from other people

242
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,339
that the bride's dress is the most beautiful clothes in the world.

243
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:26,710
I never saw it before.

244
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,450
Now I know what they said is true.

245
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,850
It's really beautiful.

246
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,920
You've never seen a bride before?

247
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,819
The people in your town don't get married and hold weddings?

248
00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:37,910
They do. But I'm a coroner.

249
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,490
I used to be a coroner.

250
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:46,199
I was considered unlucky even when I passed by someone's door.

251
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,650
A wedding is an auspicious event.

252
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,550
How would they want to invite a coroner?

253
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,130
I didn't understand these things when I was a kid.

254
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,159
Once I saw people get married. So I came up to take a look.

255
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:01,829
As a result, I was driven out before I saw the bride.

256
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:03,839
My brother even had a fight with them for that.

257
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,599
He got his head busted and rested at home for a few days.

258
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:11,049
In the end, my father took a lot of money and apologized to them.

259
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:14,110
It was then that I knew the child of a coroner

260
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,500
is different from other children.

261
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,610
Chu Chu, don't worry.

262
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,879
You are the daughter of a general now, a descendant of a loyal general.

263
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,969
After marrying Commandery Prince An, you will be Commandery Princess An.

264
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:28,360
No one will bully you again like that.

265
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,930
I know it.

266
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:34,659
But I still hope when they stop bullying me one day,

267
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:39,220
it's not because I'm a general's daughter or Commandery Prince An's wife,

268
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,189
but because they don't bully any coroner in the world

269
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:44,760
and the person who used to be a coroner.

270
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,579
And I'm not bullied as one of them.

271
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:51,250
What the coroner does is a good thing to punish the evil and uphold the good.

272
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,440
What's bad is people's prejudices.

273
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,389
But I believe these prejudices will disappear one day

274
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:58,229
and turn into tenfold and hundredfold respect.

275
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,830
I also believe there will be such a day.

276
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,390
But...

277
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,570
But what?

278
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:12,470
But... if it weren't for the emperor to grant us the marriage,

279
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:18,179
I think Princess Xiping would never have found a coroner like me to be her daughter-in-law.

280
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,540
That's what you worry about?

281
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,139
I almost forgot about it if you didn't mention it.

282
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,419
This is the heirloom of the Xiao family.

283
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:31,170
- Princess Xiping asked me to give it to you.
- Really?

284
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,720
Of course. It can't be more real.

285
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,199
Princess Xiping worries that you'll think too much about it.

286
00:17:38,199 --> 00:17:40,120
Now that she gave you the heirloom,

287
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,709
it means that she has seen you as her daughter-in-law.

288
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:45,049
You got the witness and the evidence now.

289
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,990
Why should you still worry about it?

290
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,210
Thank you, Miss Leng.

291
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,950
Rise!

292
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,310
Go!

293
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,579
Do you hear that? Be quick. Hurry up.

294
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,360
Fall!

295
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,540
This is a grand scene.

296
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,670
General Zhou, is that the emperor?

297
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:02,139
Are you blind? Who else can enjoy that?

298
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:03,559
Yes, General Zhou.

299
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,780
I just came from Qianzhou.

300
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,330
I don't know the people in Chang'an.

301
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,229
Are you sure it's real?

302
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:13,160
Why don't you go down, open the curtain,

303
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,820
and ask the emperor to have a smile for you?

304
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,330
I'm from the Shence Army. Now I'm here keeping watch with you.

305
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,390
And you don't believe me.

306
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,479
How about this? You stay here. I'll quit.

307
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:24,089
Don't. Sorry, General Zhou. Don't be angry. I was kidding.

308
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:26,900
As long as it's real.

309
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,779
I'll take a few people to the backyard.

310
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:33,910
Go on and keep an eye on them.

311
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,679
Play it by ear if anything happens.

312
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,080
Okay.

313
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,200
Let's go.

314
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,170
Greetings to Your Highness.

315
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,150
How is it going?

316
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,579
Rest assured, Your Highness. Besides here, other troops have also been arranged.

317
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:24,830
How is Princess Xiping's mansion guarded?

318
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,900
It's just as normal.

319
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,139
Looks like they are just happily preparing for the wedding.

320
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:34,829
Your Highness, Xiao Jinyu is using his wedding as bait. He also invited the emperor.

321
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:39,020
There is no way they would let up their guard.

322
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,100
Have the royal family members and the officials arrived?

323
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,980
Yes.

324
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,460
General Zhou saw them go in.

325
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,560
All of them are there.

326
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:52,599
Your Highness, it's abnormal. I'm afraid there is a trap.

327
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,690
Keep probing.

328
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,190
Yes.

329
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,290
No need.

330
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,170
Our Commandery Prince An is doing well.

331
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,279
With all these clues provided by you,

332
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,559
if he can't find this place,

333
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,089
doesn't it mean what you taught him all these years has all been forgotten?

334
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:13,299
Where is Xiao Jinyu?

335
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:14,500
[Enjoy all blessings]

336
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,520
Go!

337
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,690
The bride steps over the fire,

338
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:43,380
all the evil spirits will be sacred.

339
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,040
The new couple steps over the saddle to live a peaceful life.

340
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,380
Congratulations, Your Highness.

341
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,199
- Congratulations, Your Highness.
- Congratulations.

342
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:22,589
Princess Xiping has arrived!

343
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:24,290
Congratulations.

344
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,820
Greetings to Your Grace.

345
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,840
Greetings to Your Grace.

346
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,929
Today is the wedding day of Commandery Prince An. I hope I'm not late.

347
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,920
You finally came.

348
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,259
Once a teacher, always a father.

349
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:57,010
Today's your wedding day. How can the king not come?

350
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:01,159
Look. I also brought you a pair of gifts.

351
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,949
Xue Rucheng, let my son go!

352
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,920
Xue Rucheng, what do you want to do?

353
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,669
How can you call yourself a king in that look?

354
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:12,780
How dare you!

355
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,559
This is the fifth son of the late emperor, Duke Chang.

356
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,400
Come and pay respect to His Highness!

357
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,229
I'm the rightful emperor.

358
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,200
The tyrant stole my country and sacked my mansion.

359
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,050
I'm here today to follow Heaven's will.

360
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:31,309
Those who submit to me will be forgiven and made high officials.

361
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:34,779
Those who are against me will be punished by me according to Heaven's will.

362
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:37,320
What kind of rightful emperor are you?

363
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,800
Your real name is Xue Tang.

364
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,849
You were just a slave in Duke Chang's mansion,

365
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:42,660
Duke Chang's reading partner when he was a kid.

366
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,899
How dare you make trouble in the name of Duke Chang!

367
00:23:44,899 --> 00:23:47,000
Do you plead guilty?

368
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,660
I can't believe you said that.

369
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,499
When Duke Chang's mansion was in trouble, you weren't born yet.

370
00:23:58,499 --> 00:24:00,879
I am the rightful son of the late emperor.

371
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,000
The blood of the Li clan runs in my veins.

372
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,989
Duke Chang left Chang'an because of smallpox when he was young.

373
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:09,780
All the old officials know it.

374
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,239
Do you think changing
[Young Duke Chang, Young Xue Rucheng]

375
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,740
the medical record of Duke Chang

376
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:18,609
can conceal the fact that you are an impostor?
[Imperial Medical Service]

377
00:24:18,609 --> 00:24:20,940
You think I don't know what you are playing?

378
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,999
Do you think forging some medical records

379
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:24,509
can make lies come true?

380
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,349
You must be dreaming.

381
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,040
The medical records can be forged,

382
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,560
but scars can't be faked.

383
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,330
The smallpox is extremely dangerous.

384
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,380
Once infected, the chances of surviving are very small.

385
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,699
Even if you survived by luck,

386
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,319
it would leave scars on you that are difficult to eliminate.

387
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:42,179
Xue Tang, can you find one scar on you caused by smallpox?

388
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:46,359
Those who took a bath with him, think about it.

389
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,130
Your Highness, well...

390
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,770
Jinyu, think about it carefully.

391
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:55,129
The two of them grew up with you since childhood.

392
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:58,579
Even if you don't care about your life, are you going to let them die?

393
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,290
Jinyu.

394
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,699
Jing Yi, listen up!

395
00:25:02,699 --> 00:25:04,229
You are a descendant of the Jing clan.

396
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,559
You shall never submit to a rebel!

397
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,069
Of course!

398
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,900
The descendant of the Leng clan won't submit to a rebel, either!

399
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,799
But I'm afraid you don't have the nerve to take my life.

400
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,690
Their lives are in their own hands.

401
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:19,039
Your Highness, ask Jing Yi and Leng Yue to arrest Xue Rucheng?

402
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,429
Your Highness, don't worry. I will tie him up and bring him back to you.

403
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:25,040
No, let him tie you up and bring you to me.

404
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,800
Let him tie us up?

405
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,180
Why is that?

406
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,080
Xue Rucheng has been biding his time for so long.

407
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,269
We don't know how many men he has.

408
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,459
I have counted it.

409
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:42,899
The number of the rebels sneaking into Chang'an in disguise is only 30% of the estimated number.

410
00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:44,320
According to the news,

411
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,500
there are soldiers and horses heading for Chang'an day and night.

412
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,460
I think that's Xue Rucheng's trump card.

413
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,590
Exactly. We need to let him feel that he has the upper hand.

414
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,960
Then he will show all his cards.

415
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,450
Only in this way can we wipe out all the rebels without leaving any potential threat.

416
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:05,580
Okay, I'll listen to you.

417
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,729
But Xue Rucheng is frantic now.

418
00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:10,599
What if he will hurt them?

419
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:15,429
Mother, in order to enter Princess Xiping's mansion,

420
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:17,860
Xue Rucheng will keep us alive.

421
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,999
How are you going to get free?

422
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,860
Don't worry. I have planted someone in the rebels.

423
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,160
Zhou Han?

424
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,800
He will find a chance and do something to the ropes.

425
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,920
Then you can escape when you have a chance.

426
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,860
Hurry! Hurry!

427
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,460
Your Highness!

428
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,829
- Yue.
- Wu Jiang.

429
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:54,689
- Yes.
- Yue.

430
00:26:54,689 --> 00:26:57,270
- Escort Her Grace into the inner hall!
- Jing Yi.

431
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,080
Your Grace, let's go.

432
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,559
Good. I taught you well.

433
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:07,640
You are really good.

434
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:11,199
Once he enters Princess Xiping's mansion,

435
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:13,729
his people outside will attack Chang'an to respond to him.

436
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,400
It can build up the momentum for his rebellion

437
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,579
and attract the forces in Chang'an at the same time.

438
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,249
Senior Jing has reported it to His Majesty.

439
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,190
There will be soldiers lying in ambush to deal with them.

440
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,350
Commandery Prince An, not good.

441
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,330
They took the emperor away.

442
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:41,160
Xue Tang, how dare you!

443
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,279
Xiao Jinyu, I watched you grow up.

444
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,189
I know clearly what you are up to.

445
00:27:48,189 --> 00:27:52,369
You sent Jing Yi and Leng Yue with some men to kill me

446
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:55,079
because you knew that even if they failed,

447
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:58,470
I would still keep them alive as hostages.

448
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,599
I really taught you well, didn't I?

449
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,280
I should thank you.

450
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,840
Step aside!

451
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,449
- If it weren't for them two...
- Step aside.

452
00:28:10,449 --> 00:28:12,300
- I wouldn't be so sure.
- Don't move.

453
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,020
That I could get such a precious opportunity for General Zhou.

454
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,210
- It's you?
- Yes.

455
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,340
The person sitting in the emperor's carriage and leaving the palace

456
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,670
will be Chu Chu.

457
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,870
Chu Chu?

458
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:32,500
To scatter the forces in Chang'an,

459
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,890
Xue Rucheng ordered the rebels outside the city

460
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,379
to attack Chang'an on purpose,

461
00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:39,330
so that he can take the chance and abduct the emperor.

462
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,060
I have asked Zhou Han to follow Xue Rucheng's orders.

463
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:46,050
I will leave most of the soldiers in the front hall.

464
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,070
[Gate Front Hall]

465
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,100
Xue Rucheng will order Zhou Han

466
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,350
to sneak in from the side gate when the backyard is unguarded
[Side Gate Hengxiang Pavilion

467
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,020
and go to the Hengxiang Pavilion.

468
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,840
Chu Chu will be there disguised as the emperor.

469
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,750
Zhou Han will take Chu Chu away.

470
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:03,110
Your Highness, Xue Rucheng wants to kill the emperor.

471
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,610
If you let Chu Chu disguise herself as the emperor,

472
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,349
whether she will be recognized or not, she can still get killed.

473
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:09,309
There are so many eunuchs and maids in the palace.

474
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,189
Some of them even practiced martial arts.

475
00:29:11,189 --> 00:29:12,870
Why don't you find someone else?

476
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:15,759
Why do you have to let Chu Chu take the risk?

477
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,220
I want to do it.

478
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,450
Xue Rucheng is sinister and cunning.

479
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,690
He always has a backup plan.

480
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,810
But I'm afraid he used all of his strength this time

481
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,050
and is prepared to

482
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:32,460
die together if he fails.

483
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,990
That's right. I got some accurate news from Zhou Han

484
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,549
that there is a candle Xue Rucheng carries with him at all times.

485
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:42,730
It could be his last resort.

486
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,809
I trust His Highness and understand him.

487
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:47,860
We can cooperate really well.

488
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,960
Hold on.

489
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,520
I was also there when the emperor granted baths to the officials.

490
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,639
I remember you were white and soft.

491
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,449
There were no scars or marks on you.

492
00:30:04,449 --> 00:30:06,809
You are not Duke Chang. Who on earth are you?

493
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:10,430
I told you his name is Xue Tang. He was a studying partner of Duke Chang.

494
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,890
He is not Duke Chang. He is the fake one.

495
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,030
Don't you talk nonsense!

496
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,140
His Majesty has issued an imperial edict

497
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,900
that the Duke Chang case will be handled by the Three Judicial Offices.

498
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,160
Considering many of you were deceived by this crafty man,

499
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:27,639
those who surrender after knowing the truth will be sentenced leniently.

500
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:30,469
Those who still follow the rebel, Xue Rucheng,

501
00:30:30,469 --> 00:30:32,620
will be executed!
[Token]

502
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,259
Your Highness, I've been deceived!

503
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,160
I surrender!

504
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,470
I surrender, Your Highness!

505
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,719
Bros, what are you waiting for?

506
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:47,510
Following the fake Duke Chang will get you nowhere.

507
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,410
Surrender now!

508
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,800
- I surrender, I surrender!
- I surrender!

509
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,459
Take them down into custody.

510
00:30:52,459 --> 00:30:55,609
No need. I'll go by myself.

511
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:00,349
Xue Tang, your time has run out.

512
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:02,709
Let Chu Chu go. I'll leave you a whole body.

513
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:05,110
We don't know whose time is up.

514
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,710
You let a female coroner put on the emperor's dragon robe.

515
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,740
That's rebellious!

516
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,199
You should worry about how long you will be able to live.

517
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,859
Stop trying to stir things up. His Majesty has approved it.

518
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:17,489
His Majesty wants me to tell you

519
00:31:17,489 --> 00:31:21,710
that the prestige of the Emperor of Tang comes from diligence and love for the people.

520
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:25,260
It's not something a crown or a robe can represent.

521
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,999
People like you who only have selfish desires

522
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,399
and have no caring for the nation and the people

523
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,010
are doomed to be abandoned by everyone.

524
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:35,390
Are you not afraid that I will kill her?

525
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:39,269
If Chu Chu dies, you will have no more bargaining chips.

526
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:43,449
I will never let you go even at the cost of my life!

527
00:31:43,449 --> 00:31:45,870
Well, well, Xiao Jinyu.

528
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:50,890
You even made use of the woman you love for your own career!

529
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,340
I'll make you remember it today.

530
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,349
You gave her life to me in person.

531
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:57,889
It's you who kills her!

532
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,390
Hold on!

533
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,110
Let me replace her.

534
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,530
Jinyu.

535
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,279
Xue Tang, instead of burning your bridge,

536
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,100
why don't you let me replace her?

537
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,250
You know that I can't fight at all.

538
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,060
Taking me as a hostage can get you a way out.

539
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,300
I'll replace her. Okay?

540
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,950
- Jinyu.
- Your Highness.

541
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,400
I'll replace her.

542
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,680
Your Highness! Your Highness!

543
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,949
- Chu Chu, go back!
- Your Highness!

544
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,430
- Step back! Or I will kill him!
- Your Highness!

545
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,330
- Chu Chu, go back!
- Your Highness!
- Step back, or I will kill him!

546
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,500
Step back, or I will kill him!

547
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,690
Get off me. Your Highness!

548
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,560
Your Highness!

549
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,360
From what I know about him,

550
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,440
only letting him catch Chu Chu

551
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,089
can make him believe that I'm at the end of my wits.

552
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:11,590
Taking me as a hostage can get him a way out.

553
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:16,759
Therefore, he will agree to replace Chu Chu with me.

554
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:22,099
But in this way, you will end up in danger alone.

555
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,400
Back off!

556
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,310
Back off! Or I will kill him!

557
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,870
At this point, can you tell me the truth?

558
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:38,770
What did you say?

559
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:43,210
You used to treat me like your little brother, like your son.

560
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:48,030
Except that you wanted to benefit from the influence of my mother and Senior Jing,

561
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,460
have you ever been sincere to me?

562
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,070
Sincere?

563
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:58,120
I just wanted to make use of

564
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,639
your upright personality

565
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,820
to disturb the forces of all parties in the imperial court.

566

567
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:25,790

568
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:32,260
Credit

569
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,680
The mechanism on the door was designed by me.

570
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,640
I know its range and angle best.

571
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,170
I'll lead him there and ensure he gets hit.

572
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:43,519
Jinli is secretly practicing it in the mansion right now.

573
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,420
I'll cooperate with him.

574
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,010
We can definitely kill him.

575
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:51,090
Senior Jing, please take care of the emperor.

576
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,480
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

577
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,819
We've been weaving the net for catching the bandits.

578
00:34:56,819 --> 00:34:59,019
Now the net is hanging over these rebels.

579
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,500
It's about the time to pull out the net.

580
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:05,529
We need to work together to give them the final blow and take them down.

581
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:18,620
Thank you all for risking your lives with me and trusting me.

582
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,250
Well...

583
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,099
Your Highness, why are you doing that?

584
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:30,080
We are brothers. There is no need to say thanks.

585
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,980
That's right.

586
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:35,760
Just give me back the salary... you deducted this year.

587
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,780
That's all you care about.

588
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,860
Just like your father.

589
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,280
I didn't say anything.

590
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,700
Here is His Majesty's edict!

591
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:01,690
"Commandery Princess An, Chu Chu of the Yun clan,

592
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,420

solve strange cases and help the living by performing autopsies on the dead.

595
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,179
She is a talent indeed with a kind heart and superb skills.

596
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,300
I crave talents.

597
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,829
Today, I grant Chu Chu of the Yun clan the identity as a coroner.

598
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:19,999
She is allowed to assist Commandery Prince An

599
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,939
to investigate cases and punish evil.

600
00:36:22,939 --> 00:36:25,080

Jinli, it's early in the morning, you are...

623
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,879
Well, I can't explain it to you in a few words.

Your Highness, take a look.

626
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,869
The chickens came out from the eggs.

Catch it!

631
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,489
Jing Yi, what kind of bad habit is that?

632
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:22,890
What do you know?

633
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:27,260
This is called flying side by side.
