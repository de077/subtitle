00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,580
Why are there so many strange things in Chang'an?

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,730
Prince An really looks like the Handsome Judge.

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,880
But there is no scar on him.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,040
Minister Feng also died in a strange way.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,520
Even the owner of the restaurant is unspeakably strange.

7
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,480
The owner asked me to bring you some beauties...

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,430
and some fruits.

9
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,930
Put it there.

10
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,900
Chu Chu, watch your demeanor.

11
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,049
If you want to take advantage of His Highness,

12
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:00,760
you won't just be fined.

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,390
I... I didn't want to take advantage of him. I was saving him.

14
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,810
Save him? You almost scared him to death.

15
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,820
There are people who are still alive when their hearts stop beating.

16
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,930
It can make the heart beat again in this way.

17
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,510
Many physicians know it.

18
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,490
But it's just that it doesn't work every time.

19
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,799
So, few physicians dare to use it.

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,810
They are afraid of being accused of killing the patients.

[Jiangshan Hall]

24
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,490
If all the officials of Great Tang become Wine Immortals like Li Bai,

25
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,160
what should the court do? What should the country do?

26
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,950
What should the people do?

27
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,720
To count on me alone?

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,580
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

29
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,000
Go to draft an edict now.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,389
The seventh-rank officials or above in the capital

31
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,080
are not allowed to gather and drink on non-holiday occasions.

32
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,020
Those who break the rule will be dismissed and severely punished.

33
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,070
Yes, Your Majesty.

34
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,280
Your Majesty, what about the canonization of Feng Jie...

35
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,090
Let's talk about it later.

36
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,760
By the way, go back and tell your precious student.

37
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,950
He caught the murderer before the deadline

38
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,319
and Yan Ming's case can be closed.

39
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,599
But he should handle his social relations properly.

40
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,340
He has to do it even he fakes it.

41
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,650
Ask him to go to Feng Manor and offer his condolences.

42
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,600
Tell him this is an imperial edict.

43
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,140
Your Majesty,  Prince An has offered his condolences to Feng Manor.

44
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,900
He did?

45
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,719
I dare not deceive Your Majesty.

46
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,990
When the morning court ended,

47
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,060
Senior Jing and I went to Feng Manor

48
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,740
and we ran into Prince An.

49
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,879
Go ahead. Hurry up.

50
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,620
You are saying there was a physician who saved him like that?

51
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,319
Based on the bruise and the scratches,

52
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,170
it should be a female physician.

53
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,520
A female physician...

54
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,880
I got it.

55
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,470
The family of Feng Jie's second wife runs a medical clinic.

56
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,400
I found it weird when I was in Feng Manor.

57
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,520
Housekeeper Feng seemed suspicious when he mentioned the Second Lady.

58
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,389
He must be hiding something.

59
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,980
Your Highness, have you noticed what Madam Feng said?

60
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,530
Chu Chu said that when ashes fall on the deceased,

61
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,439
it means the dead soul is protesting an injustice.

62
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,620
Then Madam Feng immediately said "don't slander our Master".

63
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,440
Slander?

64
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,680
Chu Chu meant an injustice was done. Why would she call it slander?

65
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,019
What do you think?

66
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,120
I wasn't thinking of anything.

67
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,110
But when I saw you two...

68
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,160
Doing that... I had a thought.

69
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,490
I think Feng Jie indulged himself too much and died under a skirt.

70
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,310
It must be like this last night.

71
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,560
Feng Jie drank too much at the welcome banquet.

72
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,740
The Second Lady accompanied him home.

73
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,180
When they were doing it, Feng Jie suddenly fell ill.

74
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,880
Second Lady has little medical skills and tried to save him, but she failed.

75
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,120
The Feng Manor worried that his cause of death would bring them shame.

76
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,469
So they said Feng Jie died of a sudden illness.

77
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,260
The Feng family wants to cover the disgrace up.

78
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,749
That's why when Chu Chu said that the deceased was wronged,

79
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,140
Madam Feng blurted out the word, "slander".

80
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:28,210
Chu Chu, what do you think of Jing Yi's analysis?

81
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,250
I don't know.

82
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,500
That's not enough to explain how he died.

83
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,919
But I can tell that Minister Feng was healthy and strong.

84
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,499
He didn't drink too much before he died.

85
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,590
At least he didn't die of drinking.

86
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,591
As for whether he died under a skirt just like Lord Jing said,

87
00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:45,269
I need a thorough autopsy before I can know it.

88
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,360
What autopsy do you need?

89
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,050
Feng Jie died at his home, not in a brothel.

90
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,879
It's not wrong to say that he died of a sudden illness, right?

91
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,319
Why take it so seriously?

92
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,560
No one will look good if we reveal the true cause of his death.

93
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,170
And you will be blamed for it.

94
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,159
Your Highness, when I looked at Minister Feng,

95
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,250
I felt that he had a lot to say to me.

96
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,500
- He had a lot to say to you?
- Yes.

97
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,720
Everyone has something to say before they die.

98
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,659
It's just that some people have time to say it,

99
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,040
and some people don't.

100
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,170
Those who don't will leave these words on their bodies.

101
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,710
Some words are said through the scars.

102
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,860
Some are said through the posture.

103
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,150
Some are said through their relationships with other people.

104
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,980
The coroner's job is to interpret these words

105
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,910
to those who are alive.

106
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,040
Who told you that?

107
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,789
Did the Handsome Judge said that?

108
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,340
Yes, he said that.

109
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,490
Have you also heard of it?

110
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,520
It's also written in Father's personal letter.

111
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,520
How did she know it?

112
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,780
- I once read it in a book.
- Which book?

113
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,730
Is it the Legend of the Nine Constables in Six Gates?

114
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,300
- What legend?
- The Legend of the Nine Constables in Six Gates.

115
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,350
It was in this book that I read about Six Gates and the Handsome Judge.

116
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,290
Did you also read that book?

117
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,800
Is there any copy of this legend?

118
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,600
Yes, it's in my bag.

119
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,190
If you want to read it, I'll give it to you once I return to the Three Judicial Chief Ministries.

120
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,590
Okay.

121
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,250
Chu Chu, are you willing to check Minister Feng's body again?

122
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,370
- I can examine it?
- You can.

123
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,500
Again?

124
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,099
Really? That's great.

125
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,970
Thank you, Your Highness.

126
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,720
I should thank you.

127
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,950
Let's eat.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,540
A few days ago, you said

129
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,439
that the Emperor set a time limit for Prince An to solve a case.

130
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,930
Today is the deadline.

131
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,150
Has the case been solved?

132
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,560
Kind of.

133
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,989
Don't be ambiguous.

134
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,440
What do you mean kind of?

135
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,760
The murderer was arrested.

136
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,510
But she committed suicide in the prison of the Court of Judicial Review.

137
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,390
- The prison of the Court of Judicial Review?
- Yes.

138
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,260
Then our son...

139
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,360
Did you lie to me?

140
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,829
He didn't come back for a meal today.

141
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,860
Did the Emperor ask him to stay and want to punish him?

142
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,389
Madam, when did I lie to you?

143
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,730
Jing Yi is fine.

144
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,170
Didn't Prince An take the blame

145
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,190
for whatever mistakes they made in the Three Judicial Chief Ministries?

146
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,500
When did you hear that

147
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,920
he pushed out his subordinates and let them take the blame?

148
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,850
Is Commandery Prince An okay?

149
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,820
He is fine.

150
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,990
Han Ji and his fellows spoke ill of him.

151
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,250
What then?

152
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,199
Those who don't work speak ill of those who work.

153
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,440
I think Han Ji and his fellows are just useless ducks.

154
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,690
They only quack all day.

155
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,820
Did you speak up for Prince An?

156
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,320
Yes, I did.

157
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,520
Madam, don't worry. It's over now.

158
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,210
By the way,

159
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,639
I heard that Prince An went to Feng Manor yesterday to express condolences.

160
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,690
Did he bring a maid with him?

161
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,160
It's not a maid, but a coroner.

162
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,630
- A coroner?
- Yes.

163
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,720
Did Prince An really let a girl pass the test?

164
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,400
I don't know if she passed.

165
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,570
But he is definitely interested in her.

166
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,200
Your Highness, you are finally back.
[Two Merits Hall]

167
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,640
Did Mother send someone here again?

168
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,690
What? How did you know that?

169
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,709
Wu Jiang, you have been serving Prince An for so long.

170
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,060
Don't you know that he has a third eye?

171
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,720
Your Highness, Aunt Banxia said

172
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,840
the Princess asked you to see her as soon as you come back.

173
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,330
Otherwise, she will come to see you.

174
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,770
Did Leng Yue reply?

175
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,960
Not yet.

176
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,820
Leng Yue? What happened to Leng Yue?

177
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,511
- Send someone to rush her.
- Yes.

178
00:08:21,511 --> 00:08:23,450
Leng Yue is back?

179
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,410
Your Highness. Your Highness.

180
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,590
Your Highness, tell me about it.

181
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,400
Your Highness!

182
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,050
Your Highness. Tell me about it. Tell me.

183
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,250
You've had the meal and the tea.

184
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,860
Your tongue is glibber now.

185
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,930
Don't you have something to report to me?

186
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,060
Yes.

187
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,860
You were right.

188
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,180
There is such a person in the Shen Army.

189
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,980
Last night he suddenly asked for leave to go home.

190
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,959
There is no trace of him.

191
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,459
This is the military record. His physical features are in it.

192
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,230
Your Highness,

193
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,890
last night, you asked me to investigate it this morning.

194
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,180
You also took the morning court off for me.

195
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,780
You are taking the blame

196
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,450
for the dancer's suicide, aren't you?

197
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,320
It was my fault for being careless. It's what I should do.

198
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,130
But I interrogated her.

199
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,540
I asked you to do it.

200
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,480
You are even tougher than my father.

201
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,960
I would take being beaten one hundred times by him over what you've done.

202
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,939
How should I pay you back? By marrying you?

203
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,870
You'd better serve me.

204
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,570
Looks like it is Qin Luan who wants to catch Chu Chu.

205
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,850
But why does he want to catch Chu Chu?

206
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,300
Nothing good will happen if being targeted by these eunuchs.

207
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,860
What about being targeted by you?

208
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,120
What do you want to say?

209
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,350
I'm saying...

210
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,750
you are not just curious about Feng Jie's death, right?

211
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,180
Are you interrogating me?

212
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,169
Not at all. I won't ask you anymore.

213
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:52,610
Pretend that you are interrogating me, think about it,

214
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,910
is there no clue?

215
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,690
Clue...

216
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,309
Over the past one month, Feng Jie is the third official

217
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,860
who died mysteriously in the capital.

218
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,970
The third official who died in less than a month...

219
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,780
But they died in public.

220
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,760
In public, people still can get killed.

221
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,150
Just as fatal diseases don't always have obvious symptoms at first.

222
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,650
The most vicious killers might be hiding

223
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,740
behind the seemingly ordinary deaths.

224
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,700
If we don't find it out soon, the consequences can be disastrous.

225
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,999
Your Highness, his family members said nothing.

226
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,980
Why do you keep looking into it?

227
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,980
You should use the time to get more sleep.

228
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,130
Look at your red eyes.

229
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,120
By the way, I've interrogated the three tomb robbers.

230
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,090
They confessed everything.

231
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:38,550
I made a list and sent my men to arrest the people on the list.

232
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,279
Three or five days later, the grave robbers in the capital

233
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,580
can have a party in prison.

234
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,669
Your Highness, Qin Luan came.

235
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,600
What is he doing here?

236
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,991
He said he came to announce the Emperor's verbal edict.

237
00:10:49,991 --> 00:10:51,909
He insists on coming in. He should be at the gate now.

238
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:53,260
It won't be a good thing.

239
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,141
Jing Yi, are the three grave robbers still in the prison?

240
00:10:56,141 --> 00:10:58,759
Yes. Go to the Court of the Judicial Review's prison for me.

241
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,440
Give them a chance to atone for their crime.

242
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,020
Atone for their crime?

243
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,230
Do you want to dig out the two buried capital officials and do an autopsy again?

244
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,109
Be careful and leave from behind.

245
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,170
Don't let Qin Luan see you.

246
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,110
Rest assured.

247
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,770
You...!
[Two Merits Hall]

248
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,449
You nasty minions. Damn!

249
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,420
Commandery Prince An has arrived!

250
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,530
Eunuch Qin.

251
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,920
Your Highness.

252
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,140
Take a look.

253
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:37,830
I'm here to announce the Emperor's oral message.

254
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,389
Take a look. They won't even let me in.

255
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:44,620
Your Three Judicial Chief Ministries is well guarded indeed.

256
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,270
Not really.

257
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,750
It's just a place to store the case files.

258
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,389
Unauthorized people are not allowed in.

259
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,600
Am I also unauthorized?

260
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,530
Fine, fine.

261
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:03,029
Commandery Prince An, today you brought a coroner to Feng Manor and desecrated

262
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:07,370
the body of the Minister of War, Feng Jie, in the name of mourning.

263
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,990
The Feng family has told the Emperor about what you did.

264
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,940
Here is the imperial verbal edict.

265
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,630
Commandery Prince An, Xiao Jinyu, is ordered

266
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,150
to apologize to the Feng family in person.

267
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,959
If he disturbs the burial of Minister Feng again,

268
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,360
he will be severely punished.

269
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,050
Commandery Prince An, I hope you know what you are doing.

270
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,540
Let's go.

271
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,950
It's rare for Qin Luan to do something good.

272
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:40,500
Now we have a reason to visit Feng Manor again.

273
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,940
Master.

274
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,100
I've delivered it.

275
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,780
You are...

276
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,930
The Emperor gave an order

277
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,230
to send these things to Feng Manor.

278
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,390
Master.

279
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,669
Okay, go.

280
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,300
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

281
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,900
I've checked the female coroner from the Southwest.

282
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,960
This female coroner is from Pingle Town, Guanling County, Qianzhou.

283
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,760
However, her mother has passed away for years

284
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,720
when this female coroner was born.

285
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,829
What did you say?

286
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:24,029
When she was born, her mother had been dead for years?

287
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,190
Did she pop out from her mother's grave?

288
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,640
That's what is weird.

289
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,439
This female coroner's father is called Chu Ping.

290
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,789
It's ascertained that he only married one woman.

291
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:41,900
His wife died when she gave birth to his eldest son, Chu He.

292
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:46,029
In the tenth year of Taihe, he somehow had a daughter,

293
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,790
which is this female coroner.

294
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:52,669
Xiao Heng died in the Southwest and no one has seen his body.

295
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:57,490
Less than a year later, a coroner's family in Southwest

296
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,340
somehow had a daughter.

297
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:05,010
Now, this daughter came to Chang'an with Xiao Heng's relics.

298
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,319
How can there be such a coincidence in the world?

299
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,080
In this case,

300
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:16,950
could she be a bastard daughter of Xiao Heng?

301
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,029
Are you asking me?

302
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,499
Master, calm your anger. I'll go to find it out.

303
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:24,940
Get away! Yes.

304
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,040
Your Highness, Miss Chu presents herself.

305
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,389
Let her in. Yes.

306
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,319
Your Highness, you are back.

307
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,850
This is the Legend of the Nine Constables in Six Gates.

308
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,350
It's all here.

309
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,100
Thank you.

310
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,759
[When someone dies, the coroner goes to the land...]

311
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,790
Did you write it?

312
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,740
No, I heard of these stories from other people.

313
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,400
I didn't write these stories.

314
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,740
I mean the handwriting.

315
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,300
Yes.

316
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,210
How do you recognize my handwriting?

317
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,220
I read your exam application form.

318
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,560
So I can recognize your handwriting.

319
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,310
You remember it just with one glance?

320
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,800
That's amazing!

321
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,210
Your Highness,

322
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,770
when can I check Minister Feng's again?

323
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,670
Your Highness.

324
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,390
Come in.

325
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,010
Your Highness, Jing Yi is back.

326
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,100
Let's forget about Feng Jie now.

327
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,690
I have two bodies that I need you to check.

328
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,879
No problem.

329
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,959
Do I need to dress up as a maid this time?

330
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,700
No need. You'll do it here.

331
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,080
Get down.

332
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,170
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

333
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,810
Your Highness, it has been done according to your instructions.

334
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,890
No one will find out these two tombs are already empty.

335
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,500
You know what, the craftsmanship of these three bumpkins

336
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,430
is pretty amazing.

337
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,090
No, it's outrageous.

338
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,790
Outrageous!

339
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,709
Where are the bodies?

340
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:27,050
In the autopsy room with the coffins.

341
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,369
Okay.

342
00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:31,279
Send them to the interrogation room first and give them some food.

343
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,959
Find some people to keep an eye on them.

344
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,590
After Chu Chu finishes, ask them to take the coffins back to where they were.

345
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,010
Yes.

346
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,700
Move.

347
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:46,910
Is there an autopsy room and an interrogation room?

348
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,710
- What's wrong?
- Is there a place to store the evidence of the pending case

349
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,100
and a place to do all kinds of analysis and research?

350
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,240
How do you know that?

351
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,279
I heard of it. That's the house of the Handsome Judge.

352
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,640
He built a yard at his house.

353
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,200
There is an autopsy room, an interrogation room,

354
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,699
a place to store the evidence of the pending cases,

355
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,080
and a place to do analysis and research.

356
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,880
It's just like...

357
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,200
It's just like this place.

358
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,470
Are you the Handsome Judge?

359
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,980
You must be the Handsome Judge!

360
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,050
How old were you when you first heard about these things?

361
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,360
Six.

362
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,519
When you were six, I was also a child.

363
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,290
Even though I'm talented,

364
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:33,130
there is no way I could build a yard for myself.

365
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,220
Right.

366
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,440
But...

367
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,730
Your house...

368
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,720
This house was built in the last two years.

369
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,640
It's just a coincidence.

370
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,340
How can there be so many coincidences?

371
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,300
Guards.

372
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,309
Yes.

373
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,120
Take Miss Chu to the autopsy room.

374
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,620
Yes. Miss Chu, please.

375
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:08,260
Is this the legend of the constables?

376
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,480
This is not a legend at all.

377
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,510
Wu Jiang.

378
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,910
- Your Highness.
- Ask Lian Qiao to send some clothes to her

379
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,490
and find a chance to take her pass.

380
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:23,610
But she needs the pass to leave Chang'an.

381
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,820
Got it, Your Highness.

382
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,330
There is a strike injury in the left eye socket.

383
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,460
There is a bruise on the right side in the back of the head, and it's swollen.

384
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,460
Well... Your Highness, I still don't get it.

385
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,930
What does this mean?

386
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:02,630
These stories are all adapted from the cases my father worked on.

387
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,260
Your father's cases...

388
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,320
Are you sure?

389
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,810
I know the files of every case he worked on by heart.

390
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,470
Jing Yi.

391
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,270
If I remember it correctly,

392
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,190
apart from me and my father, there is only one person

393
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,590
who is familiar with these cases.

394
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,460
My father?

395
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,010
You are suspecting that Chu Chu works for my father?

396
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,279
I swear with my father's salary of this year.

397
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,630
I met Chu Chu at the gate of Chang'an.

398
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,029
I've told you everything.

399
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,380
You can verify it if you don't believe me.

400
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,520
There were a lot of people on the street. And the caravan.

401
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,700
- All of them can testify.
- Take it easy.

402
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,310
I'm just sorting out all the possibilities.

403
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,140
This is really impossible.

404
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,110
Your Highness, my father is skilled in

405
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,100
planting his people in all kinds of places.

406
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,760
How would he send someone with a suspicious identity?

407
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,450
Secondly, you've been avoiding women.

408
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,570
My mother knows it better than anyone else.

409
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,820
Even if my father wants to plant a coroner by your side,

410
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,800
he wouldn't find a girl.

411
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,500
Thirdly, this girl is pretty silly.

412
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,340
She is not like someone who can work for the Jing family.

413
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,930
Your Highness.

414
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,140
Have you finished it?

415
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,820
Your Highness, can I ask you a question first?

416
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,159
Go ahead.

417
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,710
Do these two deceased have any relationship with Minister Feng?

418
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,879
Why do you ask that?

419
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,010
When I looked at Minister Feng today,

420
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,719
I found an injury on his right brow bone.

421
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:53,279
It's a strike injury.

422
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,189
Generally speaking, this kind of injury isn't enough to kill anyone.

423
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:00,010
And medicine had been used on that injury before he died.

424
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,280
When I checked those two dead men,

425
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,060
I found the same injury in the same place on their heads.

426
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,110
Do you know how they got that injury?

427
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,419
It's not one injury, but two.

428
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,290
Two injuries?

429
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,580
One in the front, one in the back.

430
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,720
I'm not sure how they got it.

431
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,039
But I can give it a try.

432
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,759
Pretend that I am the killer and you are the dead?

433
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,760
Is it okay?

434
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,260
I'll be the dead man who fell into the water.

435
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,210
He had the fewest injuries and is the easiest to tell.

436
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,229
Okay.

437
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:52,410
There is a strike injury inside the right arm.

438
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,390
It should be caused by a punch.

439
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,429
There is a bruise on the left shoulder blade

440
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:01,710
which is caused by hitting a smooth hard object.

441
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:05,070
There is a bruise on the right forearm near the wrist bone.

442
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,110
There is also a strike injury on the left eye socket

443
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,200
and an injury by collision on the right back of the head.

444
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,130
You are...

445
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,130
fighting?

446
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,339
In this case, they all fought with someone before they died?

447
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,380
And the person who fought with them intentionally hit them on the face

448
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,510
in the same place?

449
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,819
That's impossible.

450
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,690
Feng Jie is a third-rank minister in his fifties.

451
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,270
Who could he fight with?

452
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:39,230
What's more, Liu Yue, the Minister of Revenue, fell off the horse

453
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,830
and many people saw it and later died.

454
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,020
He might get the injury on his head from falling off the horse.

455
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,050
No, it can't be.

456
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:49,750
The injury on his head was made earlier than his injury from falling off the horse.

457
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,300
No medicine was used on it. He didn't get it in a fall.

458
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,900
And eye sockets are sunken inward.

459
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,880
They are the lowest places on the face.

460
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,160
Even if he fell on his face, it was hard to hit his eye sockets.

461
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,999
I said before that the injury in his eye socket

462
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,229
was caused by a punch, instead of hitting the ground.

463
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,990
You are saying

464
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:11,309
that punch in the face was the fatal injury for the three of them?

465
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,820
No, that's not what I'm saying.

466
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,320
I am saying the three of them all have two similar injuries

467
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,050
in about the same places on their heads.

468
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,330
Based on their stature and injuries,

469
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,930
it should be the same person who injured them.

470
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:29,060
However, I'm still not sure whether they died of the injury.

471
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,399
It can't be.

472
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,850
There are many people who saw Liu Yue fall off the horse and die.

473
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,900
I heard that there was a group of people riding horses and hunting on that day.

474
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,680
They were chasing a rabbit with their bows.

475
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,100
[Broken leg bone]
[Bone of the left leg]

476
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,580
His left leg and ribs were fractured.
[Ribs Rib fracture]

477
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,280
There was a nosebleed which should be caused by a nose bridge injury.
[Nose bridge bones Strike injury]

478
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,230
Lord! Lord! Help! Hurry up.

479
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,639
Didn't his fall caused by his death?

480
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,679
- Hurry.
- Lord! Lord!

481
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,100
No. For those who fall to their death, their internal organs would be broken.

482
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,930
There will be blood coming out from mouth, eyes, ears and nose.

483
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,799
But this man only had a nosebleed.

484
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,380
His organs were fine.

485
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,069
The injuries on his body are not enough to get him killed.

486
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:47,390
As for the short deceased man, there is river mud

487
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,879
in his ear canal and nasal canal.

488
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,260
I think he fell into the river before he died.

489
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,180
Good wine. Lord, be careful.

490
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,630
Go away!

491
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,780
Lord, be careful.

492
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,470
I can do it.

493
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,600
Lord! Lord!

494
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,240
Hurry! Hurry!

495
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,910
Lord! Lord!

496
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,530
Come on!

497
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,980
Lord! Lord!

498
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,760
These people failed to save him.

499
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,810
But he wasn't drowned or choked to death by water.

500
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:20,780
I'm not sure the cause of his death.

501
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,060
If I can check Minister Feng's body again,

502
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,420
I might be able to know the cause of their deaths.

503
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,970
Since the injuries are the same,

504
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,679
why can you only know it through Feng Jie?

505
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,240
These two men have been dead for a while.

506
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,259
Although it looks like they haven't rotten much yet,

507
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:36,550
there are some things I can't identify anymore.

508
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,520
Especially the things in the head.

509
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,760
The things in the head?

510
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,070
What is that?

511
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,740
I'm not sure what it is.

512
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,500
I can't tell you now.

513
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,560
You...

514
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,260
How long will it take you to do an autopsy for Feng Jie?

515
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,809
- One hour.
-  I can only give you half an hour.

516
00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:54,820
Okay.

517
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:59,190
But, I need to prepare something in advance this time.

518
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,740
[Princess Xiping Manor]

519
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,800
Leng Yue?

520
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,780
That's right.

521
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,840
Leng Yue grew up in your manor.

522
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,740
You know her temperament best.

523
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,090
She loves to talk and laugh.

524
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,750
Wherever she is, that place is always lively.

525
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,190
Among your two sons,

526
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,540
Commandery Prince An is knowledgeable and reliable.

527
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,850
General Xiao is heroic and gallant.

528
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,150
They have come to the age to get married.

529
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,320
Have you ever thought about

530
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,260
who should marry Miss Leng Yue?

531
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,660
I've never thought about them

532
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,180
in that way.

533
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,590
Your Highness.

534
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,349
You should.

535
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:51,279
Miss Leng Yue is beautiful and she comes from a prominent family.

536
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,800
If someone else marries her,

537
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,460
I'm afraid you would regret it.

538
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,500
It would be a pity if she marries into an ordinary family.

539
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,800
But if your Jing Yi marries her,

540
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,240
I would be very happy.

541
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,230
Jing Yi?

542
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:13,040
Don't flatter him.

543
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,950
You know that they grew up together since childhood.

544
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,630
Miss Leng Yue listens to Commandery Prince An for everything.

545
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:24,260
Maybe her heart has belonged to Prince An.

546
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:29,369
With their childhood friendship, it's just a matter of time

547
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:32,400
for them to be together.

548
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,360
But we are not her parents.

549
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,269
She doesn't have her parents anymore.

550
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:39,230
No matter what she thinks,

551
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,790
we should ask her grandfather first, right?

552
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,990
But with my uncle's temperament...

553
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:48,300
Never mind, it's too early to talk about this now.

554
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,739
[Funeral]

555
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:58,740
Fortunately, the eunuch from the Palace warned me today,

556
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,959
otherwise, I would be fooled by the Commandery Prince An.

557
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:05,220
Although the Emperor issued a verbal edict and forbade him to keep looking into it,

558
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,580
I still can't rest assured.

559
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,919
General Zhou. How much does Eunuch Qin hate Minister Feng?

560
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,570
Why did he ask us to destroy his body?

561
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,759
That's not for you to ask.

562
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,700
If other people know that Master died under a skirt,

563
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,359
his reputation will be ruined.

564
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:26,409
Madam, don't worry.

565
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:29,710
Although Commandery Prince An came, he didn't ask anything, right?

566
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,199
That coroner is just a little girl.

567
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:36,390
I guess she is a novice and she couldn't find out anything.

568
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,740
I can't stop worrying it

569
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,430
until Master gets buried.

570
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:47,580
Madam, if you are worried, why don't we bury Master in advance?

571
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,439
You are right. Let's not wait for twenty-one days.

572
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:52,789
Tomorrow, find a Taoist who can perform the religious rite.

573
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:55,939
Tell him we want to bury Master after the first seven days.

574
00:28:55,939 --> 00:28:56,929
Yes.

575
00:28:56,929 --> 00:29:00,550
Keep an eye on them. We will do it as soon as Madam Feng leaves.

576
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,030
It's getting late.

577
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:05,479
Tomorrow morning, Master's relatives and friends will come to offer condolences.

578
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:07,500
You should go back and rest earlier.

579
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,779
Is the Second Madam sleeping now?

580
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:11,039
The Second Madam took a medicine.

581
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,110
She is sleeping now.

582
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,530
She can still fall asleep now.

583
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,460
- Madam. Commandery Prince An came with that coroner again.
- Madam.

584
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,949
What is he doing here in the middle of the night?

585
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:28,469
Madam, why don't you go back to your room and rest?

586
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,400
I'll sound him out for you.

587
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,690
Never mind.

588
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:39,570
If he found out something, it's useless to hide it.

589
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,399
Serve some tea to Commandery Prince An.

590
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,469
Ask him to wait at the side hall.

591
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,799
Yes, Madam.

592
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:49,100
Commandery Prince An?

593
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,720
Is he here in the middle of the night to do an autopsy?

594
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,010
I'm going to tell Eunuch Qin.

595
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,099
Tell what?

596
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:56,569
You are seeking your death if you tell him now.

597
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:58,270
Let's wait and see.

598
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,250
Madam.

599
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,900
Your Highness.

600
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,760
You may rise.

601
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,799
I was being suspicious in the day and I offended Minister Feng's body.

602
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,970
The Emperor reprimanded me and I feel bad about it.

603
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:22,109
I can't wait to apologize to you. So I came here at night.

604
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:24,420
Please forgive me, Madam Feng.

605
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,189
Don't say that. It's not that serious.

606
00:30:27,189 --> 00:30:29,569
I'm just a woman.

607
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:32,429
Such a tragedy happened in a sudden, I panicked

608
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,469
and talked nonsense to the people from the Palace.

609
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,630
I wasn't expecting you to be reprimanded by the Emperor.

610
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,330
It's my fault.

611
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:42,900
You are very generous to not blame me.

612
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:48,370
Please allow my maid to offer a joss stick to Minister Feng's spirit

613
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:51,180
to apologize for our offense today.

614
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,650
Steward Xu, get the joss stick from Commandery Prince An

615
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:59,740
and offer it before Master's spirit.

616
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,340
Yes.

617
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,530
We are here to apologize.

618
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,650
How can we let you do it for me?

619
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:12,710
If you mind my maid's inferiority, I can offer the joss stick in person.

620
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:16,579
I dare not. We dare not let you do that.

621
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,779
Steward Xu, take this girl there.

622
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:22,280
Yes.

623
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,690
Miss, please.

624
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,840
Master...

625
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,080
This way, please.

626
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:50,100
Madam Feng, did Minister Feng say anything when he came back last night?

627
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,950
Minister Feng went to the Southwest to inspect military affairs.

628
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,740
He was away for more than a month.

629
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,160
He must miss you a lot.

630
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,680
He was even drunk late at night,

631
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,039
he should also come to see you.

632
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:08,559
He was taken to the Second Madam's room as soon as he came back last night.

633
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,140
When I saw him, he was...

634
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:18,250
Madam, did the person who served Minister Feng last night

635
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:21,069
mention how he got the injury on his head?

636
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:23,829
Minister Han took his back last night.

637
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:27,260
He said that Master got drunk and accidentally hit something.

638
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,630
Minister Han?

639
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,430
Yes.

640
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,640
Why do you ask that?

641
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,780
Nothing.

642
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,859
It's just that Minister Feng passed away so sudden.

643
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,790
It's still hard for me to believe it.

644
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,759
Since Minister Feng was injured,

645
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:49,860
did the person who was serving him get a physician here?

646
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,569
The Second Madam's family runs a medical clinic.

647
00:32:52,569 --> 00:32:54,780
She knows a little about medicine.

648
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:58,899
When Master had a minor injury or illness, he would go to see her.

649
00:32:58,899 --> 00:33:01,550
He never saw any physician.

650
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,789
Is the cause of Minister Feng's death also diagnosed by the Second Madam?

651
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,349
Steward Xu has been away for some time.

652
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,709
Why hasn't he come back?

653
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,610
Get someone to take a look.

654
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,570
Don't offend Commandery Prince An's people.

655
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,150
Yes ma'am.

656
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,400
Madam, have you counted the belongings

657
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,159
Minister Feng brought back from the Southwest?

658
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,189
His belongings?

659
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:33,159
Minister Feng hadn't reported on

660
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,519
the inspection of military affairs in the Southwest.

661
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,010
There will be officials coming to take it over in a few days.

662
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:45,010
You'd better count his belongings and keep them safe.

663
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,800
Who is that?

664
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,379
Who went down?

665
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,859
No one, General Zhou. We are all here.

666
00:33:50,859 --> 00:33:53,470
What are you waiting for? Get him!

667
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,660
Get him?

668
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,999
Listen, if anyone disturbs Commandery Prince An,

669
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,149
everyone in Feng Manor won't get away with it!

670
00:34:01,149 --> 00:34:02,189
Yes... yes.

671
00:34:02,189 --> 00:34:03,879
You, come with me!

672
00:34:03,879 --> 00:34:05,180
Yes, sir.

673
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,980
Hurry up! Don't let the thief run away!

674
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,429
General Wu, what's wrong with you?

675
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:19,520
I have a stomachache.

676
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,220
Where is the lavatory here?

677
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,890
Go out and turn left...

678
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,880
The Feng Manor is too big. I can't find it.

679
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,580
- Take me there.
- But...

680
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,690
I'll crap my pants if you keep saying but.

681
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,829
Let's go. Come on.

682
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:35,420
This way.

683
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,700
My stomach...

684
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,400
[Funeral]

685
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,559
Not good. The coroner is inside.

686
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:44,649
She wants to do an autopsy.

687
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,250
Coroner?

688
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,129
Doesn't Eunuch Qin want to capture this coroner alive?

689
00:34:56,129 --> 00:34:58,480
Why don't we go down and take her away now?

690
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,119
Xiao Jinyu is in the side hall right now.

691
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:02,649
If we fail to take her away, then she cries for help

692
00:35:02,649 --> 00:35:05,429
and makes some noise, none of us can get out of here.

693
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,700
Do what I say.

694
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,100
Set a fire and burn the corpse and the coroner. Hurry up!

695
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,580
Okay!

696
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,050
Hurry!

697
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,600
Get him!

698
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,819
- He is over there!
- Chu Chu, you'd better hurry up.

699
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,380
Get him!

700
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,080
Okay!

701
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,150
General Wu?

702
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,159
Fire!

703
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,491
Stop chasing him, go to put out the fire!

704
00:36:07,491 --> 00:36:11,040
Fire! Fire!

705
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,500
Open the door! Open the door!

♫  I'll gently brush your hair by your ear  ♫

713
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:46,899
♫  Life is long, with love and regrets in this world  ♫

714
00:37:46,899 --> 00:37:54,019
♫  With you by my side, no matter how far I go,
we'll never be apart  ♫

715
00:37:54,019 --> 00:38:00,969
♫  With your smile, in this moment, let me
cherish this lifetime  ♫

716
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:07,979
♫  Only for you, I have to worry about the end of this life  ♫

717
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:15,549
♫  I’m still young, with my love not yet realized for you, but I'm
willing to be here for you till the end

718
00:38:15,549 --> 00:38:22,519
♫  You can rely on me in this lifetime  ♫

719
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:30,710
♫  Hope to spend this beautiful lifetime together  ♫
