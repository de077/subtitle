2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,429
Wu Chen poisoned soldiers and fabricated strange things.

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,469
He also poisoned General Leng with cinnabar.

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,620
You traitor!

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,749
Hou Bin was murdered.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,630
Wu Chen was killed and silenced.

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,750
Duke Chang is ending his plot.

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,939
He poisoned Leng Peishan with a noxious mugwort stick,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,300
murdered Feng Jie and kept Leng Peishan's condition from His Majesty to stall for time.

10
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,999
I'm sure he uses such a plan

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,950
because he wants big trouble in Leng Peishan's army.

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,970
General Leng, you think Wu Chen was the only murderer?

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,879
What do you mean? I'm all my ears.

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,949
Wu Chen is a civil official who isn't your enemy at all.

15
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,359
Why did he take so much trouble to poison you?

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,799
And why did he poison soldiers at this moment

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,779
to make such big trouble?

18
00:01:06,779 --> 00:01:12,139
Even if he finished his plan, you died and your soldiers fell into chaos.

19
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:16,450
What benefits could he get for himself?

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,349
You think someone wants to take over my troops?

21
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,669
Behind Wu Chen, there must be a long and thorough plan.

22
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,069
I'm afraid the plan is coming to an end.

23
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,359
So, he doesn't need to poison you anymore.

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,330
Coming to an end?

25
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:44,160
You mean they'll take over my troops soon?

26
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,769
General Leng, have you heard of a case

27
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,269
about illegal copper coins in Qianzhou?

28
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,310
Illegal copper coins?

29
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,039
We seldom need copper coins in the army

30
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,810
and there's been much trouble lately.

31
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:03,310
I haven't heard about what happened in Qianzhou.

32
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:09,570
Before coming here, we crashed a hideout for illegal copper coins

33
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,289
and arrested Prefect Li Zhang.

34
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,529
Hardly had we arrested him when some of your soldiers

35
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,219
set fire to his mansion?

36
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,319
What?

37
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,430
I didn't send any soldiers.

38
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,679
Oh, Hou Bin sent some soldiers to Qianzhou for material purchases.

39
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:31,020
But Hou Bin died.

40
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,320
What exactly happened?

41
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,420
General Leng, do you recognize them?

42
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,379
I do.

43
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,529
Hou Bin recruited them from bandits six months ago.

44
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:08,189
The other day, they escaped during the training outside the camp

45
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,619
because they couldn't bear the hardship.

46
00:03:11,619 --> 00:03:14,370
Did you meet them?

47
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,669
Prefect Li's neighbors identified them

48
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,999
as the soldiers who set fire to Prefect Li's mansion.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,970
They're two of the soldiers.

50
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,499
I guess they escaped because they didn't want me to recognize them

51
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,189
after I came here.

52
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,000
If I guess correctly, someone must have coordinated with them.

53
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,200
General Leng, there's another man hiding in your army

54
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,879
who's about to make trouble at any time.

55
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,620
Are you interested in catching him with me?

56
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:54,560
[The Imperial Coroner]

57
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,460
[Episode 30]

58
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,879
Turn him over.

59
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,280
Yes.

60
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,129
Come on, Chu Chu.

61
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,329
Newly cooked ﻿white plum cakes. They're still hot.

62
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:51,070
Perfect timing.

63
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,569
Put the cakes on him.

64
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,970
All right.

65
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,059
Done.

66
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,899
After the cakes are put on him, we need to wait for a while.

67
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,639
I'll guard here.

68
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,439
Miss Leng, go and get some rest.

69
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,369
How can I rest when you don't?

70
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,450
Besides, His Highness urged me to keep you company.

71
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,440
Your Highness. General.

72
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,779
How's it going? Have you gotten anything?

73
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,220
Don't be anxious. It'll be done soon.

74
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,890
Bruises?

75
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,959
He didn't have bruises when he was taken out of the well.

76
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,349
He was drowned in the well.

77
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,109
The water is cold. And he just died.

78
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:10,689
Bruises on his corpse could hardly appear directly.

79
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:14,339
Normally, they appear in one or two days.

80
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:17,449
But if we want to see the bruises earlier, we can steam the corpse

81
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:20,069
on the newly burned pit for a while,

82
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:24,439
put some paper bathed in wine vinegar where there might be bruises,

83
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,969
and put the hot white plum cakes.

84
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:30,290
If there're real bruises, they'll appear.

85
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,759
[Bruises on the back and neck]

86
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,479
Your Highness, this bruise proves that someone knocked him out

87
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,399
and drowned him in the well.

88
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,820
[Drowned in the well]

89
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,820
He's the only man who could do it.

90
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,820
Who?

91
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,530
What an easy and effective way to recognize friends and enemies with the red ribbon!

92
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,639
You're awesome, Your Highness.

93
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,619
You even predicted that rebels would get changed before the fight.

94
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,919
It's not hard to predict.

95
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,779
When two groups of men fight in the same clothes,

96
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:40,059
they'll get accidentally injured

97
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,300
without some striking changes on their clothes.

98
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,049
Go!

99
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:34,830
Your Highness, how did you know Zhao Jie was the murderer?

100
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,000
- Time.
- Time?

101
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,310
The time when he killed Wu Chen.

102
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,509
Last night when we searched for Wu Chen, Zhao Jie came very late.

103
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:50,029
General Leng, I was taking a bath and I'm late.

104
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,389
We thought he was late because he was taking a bath.

105
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,119
But after Chu Chu found something fishy on Wu Chen's corpse,

106
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,009
I asked Zhao Jie's guard outside his camp.

107
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,079
The guard told me that he had taken a bath for one hour.

108
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,679
During that, he didn't ask for more hot water.

109
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,819
Last night, I noticed his hands.

110
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,639
After being bathed in water for one hour,
[Bathed in water]
[Skin on hands]

111
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:12,490
his hands should have looked pale or had winkles.

112
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,699
That's it.

113
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,679
When he said he was having a bath, he was finding an excuse.

114
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,540
In fact, it was when he killed Wu Chen.

115
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,210
That was the time.

116
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,480
Kill him!

117
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,589
End the fight.

118
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:07,589
If we want to catch them all, we must let Zhao Jie leave first.

119
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,970
Only when they think they can win, they'll come out together.

120
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,219
Upon hearing the horn,

121
00:10:14,219 --> 00:10:16,339
General Leng's closest soldiers will fight back and besiege them,

122
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:18,589
so that none of the rebels can escape.

123
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,789
Zhao Jie!

124
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,780
You traitor! Surrender yourself!

125
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,909
This room looks neat and nothing seems special.

126
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,050
What are we looking for?

127
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,789
As the supreme commander of the rebel plan,

128
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,579
Zhao Jie must have had chances to contact his superior directly.
[The Book of Songs]

129
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:44,190
We may find some clues here about his superior.

130
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:49,830
Your Highness, are you sure Duke Chang is his superior?

131
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,319
Anyway, Zhao Jie isn't the man who manipulated the whole plan.

132
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,709
He doesn't have the ability or chances to make Li Zhang work for him.

133
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,999
He isn't able to make trouble in Chang'an, either.

134
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,009
So far, we've only arrested chess pieces.

135
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:06,540
We still don't know where the chess player is.

136
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,999
After Hou Bin died, Zhao Jie is the only man

137
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,759
who is experienced and powerful enough to take his place.

138
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,049
Once General Leng let him be the Vice Military Commissioner,

139
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,079
he would tell people General Leng was badly sick

140
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,599
and then he could take over the army.

141
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,689
Taking over the army forcibly is Zhao Jie's backup plan.

142
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,469
He didn't expect us to find out about Wu Chen,

143
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,369
so he had to kill Wu Chen hastily.

144
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,789
Before that, he might have written a letter to his master

145
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,569
about the changes.

146
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:06,910
He... He hasn't sent the letter yet.

147
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,520
Let's look for it, then.

148
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,800
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

149
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,959
It's the letter Zhao Jie hasn't sent yet?

150
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,249
Yes.

151
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,249
There are ten patterns on it.

152
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,809
Some patterns are duplicate.

153
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:37,979
I think it's a cipher letter
[4 7 3 1 5 10 8 6 2 9 8 10 7]

154
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,829
where patterns are used to represent one to ten.
[4 7 3 1 5 10 8 6 2 9 8 10 7]

155
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:44,299
When there are numbers, there should be a decoding book.

156
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,049
It's not as easy as the cipher letter Prince Consort left us.

157
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,219
Expecting someone to decode it, Prince Consort left us enough clues.

158
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,809
With it, people will decode it unless they're idiots.

159
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,999
But Zhao Jie doesn't want anyone to decode it.

160
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:59,439
If he puts the decoding book in his mind,  how can we decode it?

161
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:00,999
Even if Zhao Jie has a great memory,

162
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:04,439
he won't remember such an important thing only with his mind.

163
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:08,689
He can only remember the patterns representing ten numbers.

164
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,860
He must have a decoding book to translate the numbers into words.

165
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,740
[The Book of Songs]

166
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,429
This is the decoding book.

167
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,219
The Book of Songs?

168
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,369
Other books of his are mainly about military or national policies.

169
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,219
They haven't been read for a long time.

170
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,009
He often read the Book of Songs.

171
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,299
There're over 300 poems in it,

172
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,409
concerning astronomy, geography, phenology and folk custom.
[Sundial, compass]

173
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:26,849
The words are abundant enough for basic communication.
[Sweet Green Rice Ball, lion dance]

174
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,909
Your Highness, other books on the shelf also look clean.

175
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,930
How do you know they haven't been read for a long time?

176
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:38,279
They look clean because Zhao Jie is a senior military officer.

177
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,959
Cleaners come often.

178
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,079
But cleaners only dust the cover of the books,

179
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,279
instead of inside pages.

180
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,909
The weather is damp in the Southwest.

181
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,539
After a long time, an unopened book will be musty.

182
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:54,790
If it's not opened for years, there will be mildew.

183
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,269
Three volumes of the Book of Songs aren't musty.

184
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:59,739
Their edges are worn out, too.

185
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,129
So, he must have often read them.
[Often read with worn-out edges]

186
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,599
Your Highness, you have a sharp nose.

187
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,900
It smells really musty.

188
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,150
We've found the decoding book. But we don't know how the patterns match the numbers.

189
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,009
Ten patterns represent ten numbers.

190
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:20,020
There should be...

191
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:24,540
3.6288 million types of permutations.

192
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,760
Ye... Yes.

193
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:35,600
[4 7 3 1 5 10 8 6 2 9 8 10 7]

194
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,249
[Wu failed, I killed him. Won't join you in Chang'an as scheduled.]

195
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,279
But only one permutation can translate the numbers

196
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,550
into relevant words.

197
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,830
If we keep trying, when can we find the right permutation?

198
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,680
[Wu...]

199
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,370
Your Highness, you're incredible!

200
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:05,830
As long as you can thoroughly recite the Book of Songs, you'll figure out the words, too.

201
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:11,539
[Wu failed, I killed him. Won't join you in Chang'an as scheduled.]

202
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,730
I'm too old to move quickly.

203
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,910
Be careful.

204
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,279
Grandfather, have some water.

205
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,980
All right.

206
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,140
Grandfather, are you all right?

207
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,819
It should be me.

208
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,429
What?

209
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:56,610
It should be me who died.

210
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:04,280
Grandfather, after the problem is solved, let's go back home.

211
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,309
Let's go back to Chang'an.

212
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,609
There are the best doctors in Chang'an. They'll cure you.

213
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,719
My silly granddaughter, don't take the doctor's words seriously.

214
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:23,980
Can I really live

215
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,279
as long as the doctor says?

216
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,820
Can't you just listen to me once?

217
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,780
All right. All right.

218
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,830
Yue'er, something in this world matters more

219
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,559
than keeping us alive.

220
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,589
Or Commandery Prince An wouldn't have come here.

221
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:50,519
You wouldn't have come here with him, either.

222
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,229
It's unrelated at all.

223
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,879
What does it have anything to do with your disease?

224
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,430
All right, Yue'er.

225
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:01,149
Just take care of yourself.

226
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:04,090
Don't bother about me.

227
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,489
General.

228
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,129
- How's it going, Jinyu?
- Have you found something?

229
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,299
It's what Zhao Jie said in the letter to his superior.

230
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,559
Wu failed. I killed him.

231
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,579
Won't join you in Chang'an as scheduled.

232
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,579
It meant Wu Chen failed and was killed.

233
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,410
Join you in Chang'an? Join?

234
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,899
I'm afraid there's another group of rebels.

235
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,789
They picked a date to join each other in Chang'an.

236
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,879
We'd better find the detailed list.

237
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,069
Even if we can't, we should estimate a number.

238
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,559
Otherwise, people in Chang'an can hardly deal with them.

239
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,900
Our priority is to interrogate the captured rebels.

240
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,460
Jing Yi, go interrogate them.

241
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,429
He doesn't need to go.

242
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,079
- They were all executed.
- What?

243
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:50,189
They were bandits.

244
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,070
General Leng didn't kill them

245
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:55,349
because he had pity on them who did bad things for a living.

246
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,969
In case they hurt common people, he recruited them.

247
00:18:58,969 --> 00:19:01,469
About this, soldiers have a lot of criticism.

248
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,039
They made trouble again.

249
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,949
If General Leng didn't kill them immediately,

250
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,490
he could hardly convince his subordinates.

251
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,109
All right. I have no job now.

252
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,709
None of them are alive.

253
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,369
Your Highness, let me have a try.

254
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:16,569
- What do you mean?
- Let me do the autopsy.

255
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:21,509
Now that they're dead, you should let me find clues from their corpses.

256
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:24,289
They look like soldiers who have received training for years,

257
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,659
but we may find traces of old lives

258
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:28,309
in their internal organs or skeletons.

259
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,300
If I can do the autopsy, I may find some clues.

260
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,709
All right. Do the autopsy.

261
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,500
In whatever way you want.

262
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,519
Brother, take her there immediately.

263
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,920
All right.

[Modern and Ancient Antiquities]

266
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,379
It's a pleasure to see you, Eunuch Qin.

267
00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:06,409
I'm sorry that I haven't welcomed you.

268
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:09,070
I'm sorry.

269
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,050
Are you an idiot?

270
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,360
I told you this is...

271
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,419
My subordinates bothered you the other day.

272
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,790
Please kindly forgive them.

273
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,189
Search the place carefully!

274
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,030
- Yes!
- You!

275
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,870
- What...?
- Go.
- Yes. Yes.

276
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:33,319
Show me all your purchasing lists of this year.
[Account Book]

277
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:36,249
These things look like imperial things. I'll take them back for inspection.

278
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:38,189
If they're not, I'll return them to you.

279
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,979
This one looks like an imperial thing, too.

280
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,350
It doesn't matter, Eunuch Qin.

281
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,519
The Ruyi you gave me...

282
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,200
I had it discerned very carefully.

283
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,699
It's quite a precious thing. Thank you.

284
00:20:55,699 --> 00:20:56,919
It's just a little gift.

285
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:02,340
It's quite my honor that you accept it.

286
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:11,479
- The words carved on the copper Ruyi look quite interesting.
- Yeah.

287
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,829
I'm interested in that.

288
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:18,469
May I have a word with you?

289
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,879
Sure. Sure.

290
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,639
It's my honor.

291
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,140
Come, please.

292
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,159
Please stay, Eunuch Sun.

293
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,960
Come this way, please.

294
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,349
I...

295
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,850
Come, please.

296
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,640
Tell me. Where's Xu Rugui?

297
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,679
Don't worry, Eunuch Qin.

298
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,059
When Xu Rugui first came back to Chang'an, he was dying.

299
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:03,039
Luckily, he struggled to live.

300
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:09,380
After a period of treatment, he can talk now.

301
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,660
Just get to the point.

302
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,279
I'm quite busy with palace business

303
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,949
and I don't have time for useless talk!

304
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:25,109
You served three emperors and you investigated it a few times.

305
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,450
Then you should know

306
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:32,800
what Duke Chang suffered in Qianzhou, right?

307
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,799
Duke Chang?

308
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,660
It's said that a group of bandits

309
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,429
attacked his mansion in Qianzhou.

310
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,229
His family was slaughtered.

311
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,930
Everyone in his mansion was killed.

312
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,039
No one stayed alive.

313
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,060
Not bandits.

314
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,509
What did you say? They weren't bandits?

315
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:13,519
It wasn't bandits who slaughtered Duke Chang's family,

316
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,500
but an official army from the palace?

317
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,330
Official army?

318
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,189
How do you know that?

319
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,189
Duke Chang witnessed that.

320
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:30,049
His Highness exchanged clothes with his study companion

321
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,419
and hid among corpses so that he could survive.

322
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:38,150
He never forgot such a miserable scene.

323
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:43,150
I see.

324
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:51,369
But why does it concern me?

325
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:56,879
Eunuch Qin, His Highness knows that you're caring for him.

326
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,969
He also wants to talk to you about old affairs.

327
00:24:01,969 --> 00:24:04,919
But it's not convenient for him to come now.

328
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,309
So, I've been asked to entertain you to resolve the misunderstanding

329
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:13,960
that we sold imperial objects

330
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,870
and also to reassure you.

331
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:20,770
When His Highness takes care of Xu Rugui,

332
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:25,610
it'll do no harm to you.

333
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,720
You're threatening me?

334
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,820
I don't dare to.

335
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:43,519
Eunuch Qin, His Highness wants to cooperate with you to kill the tyrant,

336
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,829
take back the throne belonging to him and restore our nation.

337
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:53,860
We rely on you to do such a great thing!

338
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,650
Cheers.

339
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:12,120
Now that His Highness wants cooperation, shouldn't I meet him first?

340
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,510
He's been waiting for you.

341
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,600
He's in Chang'an?

342
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:46,219
- Who's that?
- It's me, Master. I'm Mingde.

343
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,939
Master.

344
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,339
Aren't you on duty today?

345
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,389
Why are you coming here, instead of serving His Majesty?

346
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,799
Don't get angry, Master.

347
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,399
Last night, His Majesty had a cold.

348
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,799
When he got up this morning, he felt sick and he was angry.

349
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,469
He kicked me out when he didn't want to see me.

350
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:07,289
Master, we're going to make Duke Chang the emperor.

351
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:12,620
Why don't you do away with the present emperor?

352
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,480
What do you need your head for?

353
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,319
To make you look like a human?

354
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,260
Please enlighten me, Master.

355
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:24,839
The present emperor is quite a tough man.

356
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,279
He pretended to be insane and fooled everyone.

357
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,519
Now, he's trying to suppress our division.

358
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,529
He sounds us out from time to time.

359
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:42,359
Cunning Jing Zhi is also making trouble with the other officials.

360
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,429
Do you think we can dethrone him so easily?

361
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:51,829
If we don't act carefully and make him realize something,

362
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,559
we'll be killed first!

363
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,399
Serve His Majesty carefully.

364
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,639
Our priority is to kill Xiao Jinyu and his men

365
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,400
in case he ruins the big plan Duke Chang and I have.

366
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,589
Don't worry, Master.

367
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,469
I'll make careful arrangements.

368
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,829
I won't let Xiao Jinyu come back alive.

369
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,709
All right. Go get it done.

370
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,210
Yes.

371
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:27,069
Today, I come to you for a clear answer.

372
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,800
The soldier from Qianzhou...

373
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,600
Who's he?

374
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,339
Don't worry, General Leng. He isn't a bad man.

375
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,990
I certainly know he isn't.

376
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:42,670
My granddaughter looks at him

377
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:49,400
in the exact way her mother looked at her father.

378
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:54,180
Could he be Vice Minister Jing Yi,

379
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,679
the son of Senior Jing?

380
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,080
You have sharp eyes, General Leng.

381
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,960
So, he really is.

382
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:14,299
I hear that Jing Yi is good at identifying lies.

383
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:20,069
Did you disguise him like that and put him in my military clinic

384
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:24,159
so that he could get more intel?

385
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,449
It was expedient.

386
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:29,010
No offense, General Leng. Please understand.

387
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,809
Your Highness.

388
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:41,910
Chu Chu, what have you got?

389
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,959
Your Highness, it's so weird.

390
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,399
What have you got?

391
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,799
General Xiao, are you sure they were recruited as bandits?

392
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,639
Yes. I'm quite sure.

393
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,899
No way.

394
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,279
Not all of them are bandits.

395
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,879
Not all of them?

396
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,829
- What are they, then?
- Soldiers.

397
00:28:58,829 --> 00:29:00,679
Soldiers who had been trained for years.

398
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,149
No way!

399
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:06,109
I picked ten corpses of different batches of recruitments.

400
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,179
Then I found that four of them were trained in the army.

401
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,780
They never lived as bandits.

402
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,999
They used to be bandits many years ago.

403
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,679
It's normal when you can't find such traces.

404
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,999
It's not.

405
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,109
His Highness said that there would be traces of any action.

406
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,069
There would be traces with bodies, too.

407
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:30,279
No one can easily hide what a life he used to live.

408
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,660
His body would record everything.

409
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:39,040
If they're real bandits, what traces should be recorded?

410
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,529
Bandits run about in the mountain.

411
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:45,109
So, they have strong shanks and a strong heart.
[Leg]
[Heart]

412
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,799
Their patellae are usually worn out

413
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,519
with frequent injuries and sprains.

414
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,629
There're traces of recovery on their skeletal muscles

415
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,349
after they have fractures.
[Fractures on arms and legs]

416
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:59,479
But among the ten men, only six have such features.

417
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,509
They were obviously bandits for a long time.

418
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,579
The other four men have some features
[Unknown]

419
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,520
like Military Commissioner's soldiers.

420
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,489
No way! They were definitely recruited from the den of bandits.

421
00:30:11,489 --> 00:30:14,449
Brother, I remember you said that

422
00:30:14,449 --> 00:30:17,789
bandits in Qianzhou not only caused trouble to the Military Commissioner's army,

423
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:20,529
but also disturbed the battalion of Qianzhou Army.

424
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:21,709
Is that so?

425
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,109
Yes.

426
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,479
Qianzhou Army isn't like us.

427
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,069
They never fight hard with the bandits.

428
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:32,319
When they robbed Qianzhou Army, they snatched money and food.

429
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,519
Did they also snatch soldiers?

430
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,879
Snatch soldiers?

431
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,300
They did, as I heard.

432
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,490
Maybe soldiers were taken away to do labor work.

433
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,229
When failing to defeat them,

434
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,010
did Qianzhou Army keep recruiting more soldiers?

435
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,890
I'm not sure about that.

436
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,329
Your Highness, you mean...?

437
00:30:50,329 --> 00:30:53,229
Brother, go get the recruitment record of Qianzhou Army

438
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,910
with my official seal.

439
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,720
All right. I'll be on my way.

440
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,549
- Eunuch Qin.
- Go. Go.

441
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:16,999
Eunuch Qin.

442
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,900
Minister Han.

443
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,480
Eunuch Qin.

444
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:27,659
Minister Han, His Majesty forgot to tell you something when he talked to you.

445
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:30,169
He asked me to wait here for you

446
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:32,269
so that I could bring you the message.

447
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:36,080
Minister Han, may I have a word with you?

448
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,910
Eunuch Qin, just get to the point.

449
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:50,930
Minister Han, I told on Princess Xiping to you the other day.

450
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:54,040
Do you not remember it at all?

451
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,659
I'm still checking on that.

452
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:00,399
What?

453
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,760
With two witnesses, you still doubt that?

454
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:13,829
Eunuch Qin, I've verified the two ladies.

455
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:17,109
They did work for Princess Xiping.

456
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:23,569
But you want to tell on Princess Xiping with some useless words from two ladies?

457
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:25,879
Even if you report to His Majesty,

458
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,109
Princess Xiping will defend herself with clever talk.

459
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:34,169
It's a big crime to deceive His Majesty.

460
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:37,440
I can't be too careful.

461
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:46,030
Do you mean there isn't enough evidence

462
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:49,520
to close the case?

463
00:32:55,830 --> 00:33:01,799
Well, please take care of the case and make further investigation.

464
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,279
But I'm telling you.

465
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,709
What's faked can't be true.

466
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,919
You'll find out something.

467
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:13,350
Minister Han, His Majesty has drafted a decree

468
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,709
to get Commandery Prince An back to Chang'an.

469
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,859
You must hurry up.

470
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,829
Let me remind you.

471
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:25,709
To do something big, you must be daring and ruthless!

472
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:29,100
Don't show petty kindness!

473
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,250
Trying to fob me off?
