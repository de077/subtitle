1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,080
In His Highness's heart,

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,929
am I only a tool to look for Sir Witch Doctor?

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,289
From Chang'an to Qianzhou,
[The ninth day of the tenth month]

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,550
did he pay attention to me, simply for this pendant?

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,419
He investigated my family background

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,820
and threatened me with my families.

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,080
What do I mean to him?

8
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,309
The pendant is quite important.

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,010
I have to check on it.

10
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,680
But anyway, I feel sorry for her.

11
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,810
Maybe this is where we have to leave each other.

12
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:51,990
Timing and subtitles brought to you by The Imperial Coroners @ Viki.com

13
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,849
My Lord, it just rained.

14
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,169
But you came out in such a rush?

15
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:57,799
Why don't you go until it clears up?

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,309
I haven't made dealings with Commandery Prince An before.

17
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:05,369
But considering how he deals with criminal cases of different states,

18
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,859
he certainly knows everything very well before making any decision.

19
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,739
This time, he asked me to handle the illegal coining case.

20
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:16,879
I feel quite agitated.

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,959
Qianzhou is within your jurisdiction.

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,299
Commandery Prince An can't work well when he first comes to a strange place.

23
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,779
It makes sense when he asked you to take care of the case.

24
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:24,780
You have no idea.

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,339
Xiao Jinyu never plays by the rules.

26
00:01:27,339 --> 00:01:29,249
What shall we do, then?

27
00:01:29,249 --> 00:01:31,450
Let's get back to Yamen first.

28
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:42,139
[The Imperial Coroner]

29
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,980
[Episode 13]

30
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,800
Look carefully and keep it in mind!

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,479
Isn't he Shen Yu, the new Capital Liaison Representative of Qianzhou?

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,079
I'm telling you.

33
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,359
Keep a close eye on him as soon as he arrives in the capital.

34
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,109
- Pay special attention to whomever he contacts.
- Yes.

35
00:02:08,109 --> 00:02:09,850
- Sun Mingde.
- Yes.

36
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,039
Go check the sheet again.

37
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,280
Sheet?

38
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,650
Of Rugui House? What shall I check?

39
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:20,270
Anything about the Southwest and Qianzhou.

40
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,779
Master, why do you suddenly want that?

41
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,580
Ask no questions!

42
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,360
I still feel something fishy.

43
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,949
Keep a close eye on Princess Xiping's Mansion, Xue's Mansion, Jing's Mansion,

44
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:39,079
and the Three Judicial Offices.

45
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,480
Yes.

46
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,850
As for Xiao Heng...

47
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,370
When I say he's dead,

48
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,270
he's completely dead!

49
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,410
- Yes.
- Yes.

50
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,579
[Princess Xiping's Mansion]

51
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,129
Jinyu and Jinli are still young.

52
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:24,389
I don't want them to be famous, but to always be safe.

53
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,909
Unexpectedly, the court is quite changeable.

54
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,289
When I'm not a part of the court, I can hardly defend them.

55
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:34,319
Sir, I hope you can help them.

56
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,829
Don't flatter me, Your Grace.

57
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,650
I'll spare no effort to pay you back.

58
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,999
I'm confused about something.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,729
Can you enlighten me?

60
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:49,830
Be free to ask me, Your Grace.

61
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,499
You're now the Minister of War.

62
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:56,160
Have you heard of anything from the Southwest Army?

63
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,930
The Southwest Army?

64
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,230
Do you mean General Leng in Qianzhongdao?

65
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,170
I...

66
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,720
I haven't heard of anything about the Southwest.

67
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,209
Your Grace, what kind of intel do you want?

68
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,599
Anything unusual.

69
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,519
Unusual?

70
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:26,329
This is very serious.

71
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:29,550
Please pay attention while in the Ministry of War.

72
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,070
I understand your concern.

73
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,549
Rest assured.

74
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll try to get enough information.

75
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,540
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

76
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,469
Grandfather, it's all my fault.

77
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:55,229
I got our family in trouble.

78
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,649
What are you talking about, Chu Chu?

79
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:01,929
It's our destiny to meet your mother.

80
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:06,180
It means you're destined to be one of our family.

81
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,789
This is our fate, too.

82
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,180
What exactly happened?

83
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,289
Tell me about it.

84
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,270
I won't let anyone bully you!

85
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,269
No, Grandfather.

86
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,770
He... He isn't an ordinary official.

87
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,770
He's Commandery Prince An.

88
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,250
Commandery Prince An?

89
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,199
You mean Commandery Prince An

90
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,620
who takes care of Three Judicial Offices and all criminal cases?

91
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,750
Commandery Prince An...

92
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,039
I was too heady.

93
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,389
He's such an important official

94
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,900
that even the Minister of Justice and Vice Minister

95
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,719
of the Court of Judicial Review take orders from him.

96
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,230
But I annoyed him so greatly.

97
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,250
It was my fault.

98
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,039
Chu Chu, I'll go beg him.

99
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,759
If he feels unhappy, I'll ask him to punish me!

100
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,599
Grandfather. Father. Brother.

101
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,829
You raised me up.

102
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,069
Over the past years, you've been protecting me.

103
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:16,039
For me, you lived with anxiety and were gossiped about.

104
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,239
I've grown up now.

105
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,159
I should take responsibility for what I did.

106
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,270
This time, I'll protect our family!

107
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,239
Miss Chu, Jinyu asked to see you.

108
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,689
Don't be scared. I'll go with you!

109
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:31,829
Jinyu wants to see her alone.

110
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,899
This is my family!

111
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,719
Chu He!

112
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,230
Brother, don't worry.

113
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,070
I'll handle that.

114
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,229
Greetings, Your Highness.

115
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,030
Raise your head.

116
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,200
Look at me.

117
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,639
Today, I made clear about your family background.

118
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,919
Considering your performance in the Coroner Qualification Test,

119
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,520
you can have the certificate of coroner.

120
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,340
The relevant paper will be issued in a couple of days.

121
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,550
Certificate of coroner?

122
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,920
I lied a few times to you.

123
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,319
But about this, I'm not lying.

124
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,199
You're indeed a great coroner.

125
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,289
When I first met you at the test, I wanted to hire you.

126
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,590
But, Chu Chu,

127
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:49,109
an official like me must be very cautious.

128
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,509
Every decision I make concerns the safety of the people around me.

129
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:56,109
So, I can't make a choice, depending on my likes or dislikes.

130
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,199
There's a lot about you that confuses me.

131
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,199
It doesn't mean I don't trust you.

132
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,159
But I have to be very cautious.

133
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,730
If I want to keep you with me, I must know everything about you,

134
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,409
for their good, and also for your own good.

135
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:13,410
For my own good?

136
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,789
Jinyu is really all right?

137
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,970
He is. He was just exhausted and then annoyed.

138
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,910
He simply needs some good rest.

139
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,379
Wasn't he doing all right just now?

140
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,389
Who annoyed him so greatly?

141
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,639
He...

142
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,639
It's a long story.

143
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,349
Come on. Can you really treat him?

144
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,229
He felt sick all the way here.

145
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,809
Shall I get a doctor from town and have him checked?

146
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,999
He's all right. Don't mess about.

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,040
Just ask him to get more rest.

148
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,689
But I'm still worried.

149
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,259
Why is he so weak?

150
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,200
He even spat out blood out of anger.

151
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,150
Think about it. What food should I feed him?

152
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,880
Just stay and take good care of him.

153
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,999
But...

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,240
What shall I feed him for nutrition?

155
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,199
People think I consider everything very carefully.

156
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,789
In fact, I simply know a bit more before I make any decision.

157
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:12,199
The more I know, the better my plan will work.

158
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,789
I still don't know what the man behind it wants.

159
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,499
You also hide a lot from me, instead of telling me the truth.

160
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:20,859
I couldn't stop worrying on my way and I couldn't even sleep;

161
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:24,279
in case I have an imperfect plan, make a mistake,

162
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,680
and then get you in irreparable trouble, simply because I don't know enough about you.

163
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,940
Everyone has their secrets.

164
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,739
I don't blame you when you refuse to tell me.

165
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,769
But I must figure everything out in other ways.

166
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:38,399
I know what I did would make you unhappy.

167
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,980
But compared to your safety, I prefer...

168
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,519
I prefer to make you hate me.

169
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,590
No, I don't hate you.

170
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,789
You think I threatened you with your family.

171
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,100
Aren't you hating me already?

172
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,149
You don't trust me anymore.

173
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:05,269
If I force you to work for me, it'll do nothing good for us.

174
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:09,059
I'll sign the paper to prove you as a coroner.

175
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:12,149
I can recommend you, no matter where you want to work.

176
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,959
You're wrong, Your Highness.

177
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,250
I don't hate you. I just...

178
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,589
Your Highness, you're perfect.

179
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,569
You're smart and upright.

180
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:28,289
Especially when you solve a case, you're almost shining like the sun.

181
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:31,079
Such a good man like you treats me so nicely.

182
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,310
Except for the Chu family, no one has been so nice to me before.

183
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,440
I'm just scared.

184
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,670
What if it's an illusion?

185
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,650
Chu Chu, I'm nice to you

186
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,790
because you're worth it.

187
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,829
Your Highness, I'm not going anywhere.

188
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:54,569
I want to work for you.

189
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:55,979
Let me take the test again.

190
00:10:55,979 --> 00:10:57,549
I'll work hard.

191
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,850
I'll trust you and I won't annoy you again.

192
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,149
Don't bother.

193
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,899
Your Highness.

194
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:08,160
- Don't bother to take another test.
- Really?

195
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,230
When you agreed to work for me, that's exactly what I wanted.

196
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,630
- Don't trust me again?
- I do. I trust you.

197
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:20,349
I'll work hard and become the world's best coroner.

198
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:25,230
So, you'll no longer punish my family?

199
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,399
Stand up.

200
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,789
Do something for me.

201
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,660
After you make it, I'll let them go.

202
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,780
What is it, Your Highness? I'll make it.

203
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,709
I want some chicken soup.

204
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,179
Don't make it oily.

205
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,219
No blood foam. No grease.

206
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:42,129
It should taste strong, but also light. Can you do that?

207
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:44,590
Yes. I'm going right away.

208
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,529
- Brother.
- Chu Chu,

209
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,100
are we really safe now?

210
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,639
I was so stupid that I misunderstood His Highness.

211
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,669
Luckily, he forgave me.

212
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,910
When I can work for him, our family will be safe.

213
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,029
That's great.

214
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,190
I feel like I was in a dream.

215
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:33,430
Have you made up your mind to work for him ever after?

216
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,580
Then...

217
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,900
After you go back to Chang'an with him,

218
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,670
will you not come back again?

219
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,759
I will. This is my home.

220
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:53,110
Why would I never come back again?

221
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,669
Brother, this is forever my home.

222
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,669
I'll look after Grandfather and Father, together with you.

223
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,319
I'll also work hard as a coroner.

224
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,790
I won't ever humiliate our family.

225
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,559
What are you talking about?

226
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,520
- Nothing, Father.
- Father.

227
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,690
She's making chicken soup.

228
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,470
Be quick. Be quick.

229
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,490
Miss Chu is an orphan?

230
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:21,200
What her family said makes me think she's poor, but also lucky.

231
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,830
It's said that everyone in this world

232
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:29,010
cares for nothing, but profit.

233
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,199
The Chu family live such a poor life,

234
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,230
but they still raise up an orphan who brings no profit to them.

235
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,590
Those rich families where siblings fight for money should be ashamed.

236
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,249
Only these kind men in the Chu family managed to cultivate Chu Chu

237
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,669
to be such an upright and brave girl.

238
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,789
Yes.

239
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,590
But look at you.

240
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:57,619
When she annoyed you, you could have scolded her.

241
00:13:57,619 --> 00:13:59,810
Why were you so angry?

242
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,199
I don't know, either.

243
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,800
What?

244
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,519
Now, I don't think I should have been so angry.

245
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,800
When I asked Jing Yi to check on her,

246
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,430
I knew she would blame me.

247
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,540
I expected that.

248
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,960
I shouldn't have been so angry.

249
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,549
I don't know the reason, either.

250
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,939
Sorry for making you laugh.

251
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:22,519
You think I can still laugh?

252
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,839
I was scared to death.

253
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,399
I think you're exhausted.

254
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,319
Leng Yue said you needed some good rest.

255
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,319
Why don't we live in the government office?

256
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,000
The conditions there are better for your recovery.

257
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,929
I don't know how Jing Yi is doing with his mission.

258
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:37,750
Let's not decide before asking him.

259
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,519
You haven't found Xu Rugui yet?

260
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,399
Not yet.

261
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,540
Haven't you gotten anything useful from the men we captured?

262
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:52,690
They were simply ordered to kill me and kidnap Chu Chu.

263
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:56,470
They don't know why they had to.

264
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,989
They also don't know who Xu Rugui exactly is.

265
00:15:00,989 --> 00:15:05,099
Jinyu, I wonder if I should say something now.

266
00:15:05,099 --> 00:15:08,559
- But...
- Brother, if I even have to guess what you are trying to say,

267
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,349
I'll be exhausted to death.

268
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,939
Don't say that.

269
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:15,829
I mean now that Miss Chu is straightforward

270
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:17,689
and there's nothing fishy with her background,

271
00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:21,500
why doesn't she tell us about our father?

272
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,700
Come in.

273
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,120
Your Highness.

274
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,339
Take your time. I'll leave you alone.

275
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,499
General Xiao, there's a lot of chicken soup in the kitchen.

276
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,929
Why don't you go have some?

277
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:44,230
All right.

278
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:01,220
After hiding Chu Chu's secret for so many years, we finally told her.

279
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,660
I never expected to tell her in this way.

280
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,109
Luckily, she understood.

281
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,329
Also, Commandery Prince An is sensible.

282
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:13,909
Everything will not change.

283
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,539
That's great.

284
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:17,789
You're wrong.

285
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,809
What did you say?

286
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:22,879
Father, Chu Chu now knows who she is.

287
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,659
Something will change.

288
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:26,229
She hasn't thought about it carefully.

289
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,659
After she does, she'll look for her own father.

290
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:30,549
Didn't I tell you?

291
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,679
Her father died because his family suffered from disaster,

292
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,639
and then her mother fled to our village.

293
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,900
What about other relatives?

294
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,519
Blood is thicker than water, anyway.

295
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,320
I can understand

296
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,190
if she wants to look for her relatives.

297
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,000
Father, you saved her life.

298
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,999
If she really wants to leave for her other relatives,

299
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,740
do you want to let her go?

300
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,900
I don't, but what can I do?

301
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,670
I can't stop her from finding her other relatives.

302
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:18,890
I adopted her because she was helpless and poor.

303
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,910
Over the past years, I've never wanted anything from her.

304
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,509
I'll be relieved as long as she lives a good life.

305
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,410
Father, I don't mean I want anything from her.

306
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,700
I... I have a way to satisfy both.

307
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,520
What is it?

308
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,919
Let me marry her.

309
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,279
Then she'll be my wife.

310
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:45,660
Whether she wants her own family or not, she'll be one of our family.

311
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,489
Chu He, do you know what you're talking about?

312
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,200
No, Father. Don't get me wrong.

313
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,339
I don't simply mean keeping her to our family.

314
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,360
I really like her.

315
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,560
Since when?

316
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,359
I don't know.

317
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,810
When I was little, I knew she wasn't my real sister.

318
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,159
I had pity on her and took good care of her.

319
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,919
But a few days ago,

320
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,759
she went to Chang'an for the Coroner Qualification Test.

321
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,469
You and Grandfather told her that

322
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,729
if female coroners were not accepted in Chang'an,

323
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:26,569
just like other places, she would come back

324
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,409
and marry someone who was nice to her.

325
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:33,060
At that time, I thought

326
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,699
if only she would marry me!

327
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,919
Chu He, even if you like her,

328
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,720
she won't marry you unless she likes you, too.

329
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,589
I know.

330
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:50,190
Anyway, I'll take care of her forever.

331
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,120
General Xiao,

332
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,879
what do you need?

333
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,169
I came to get some chicken soup.

334
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:06,799
It's being simmered. Let me get some for you.

335
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,789
No. I suddenly have something else to do.

336
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:10,430
Don't bother.

337
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,099
That's all we can do.

338
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:37,129
It's been days since Commandery Prince An and Vice Minister Jing left the capital.

339
00:19:37,129 --> 00:19:40,120
They should have arrived in Qianzhou, I guess.

340
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,440
Senior Jing, have you heard from them?

341
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,579
Not at all.

342
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,429
Minister Wang, you know the way Commandery Prince An always behaves.

343
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,489
He's very strict in sending messages.

344
00:19:55,489 --> 00:19:59,249
Since Jing Yi left the capital, he hasn't even sent one single letter home.

345
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:00,819
You're right.

346
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:03,489
Since His Highness found the murderer who killed Yan Ming,

347
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,129
he's been tightly encircling Three Judicial Offices,

348
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:09,560
as if guarding against someone.

349
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,610
Senior Jing, everybody,

350
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,480
after Yan Ming died,

351
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,200
I heard that he had talked wildly during the banquet,

352
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,459
saying he found evidence that

353
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:26,380
Emperor Wuzong's son, Duke Chang was still alive.

354
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,260
Minister Xue, didn't you hear of that, too?

355
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,240
I heard about it.

356
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,450
But Yan Ming simply talked nonsense after he was drunk.

357
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:49,799
As far as I know, Yan Ming never talks nonsense.

358
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,260
If it's true,

359
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,780
Yan Ming must have been killed for that.

360
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,349
Minister Han, you know more about his case.

361
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,259
What are you talking about?

362
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:07,399
How can I know more?

363
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,679
Commandery Prince An solved the case.

364
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,999
I simply know how much he said.

365
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,659
You heard him, too.

366
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:18,199
He said that the murderer poisoned himself in prison of the Court of Judicial Review.

367
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:21,049
But why was Yan Ming killed?

368
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:25,470
There wasn't even an answer until His Highness left the capital.

369
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,759
This time, he has gone to the Southwest,

370
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,079
packing light with a few attendants,

371
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:39,379
looking for his father who was dead there.

372
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:41,159
Could he...

373
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,960
What?

374
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,580
Why don't you understand, Minister Xue?

375
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:53,080
Qianzhou was Duke Chang's fief.

376
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,980
Master!

377
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,820
Wang Jun said that Duke Chang was still alive.

378
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,709
Duke Chang?

379
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,230
That's what he said.

380
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,919
Ridiculous!

381
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,859
How dare he say that!

382
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:31,759
To be honest, Master, I've heard a lot about that in the palace these days.

383
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,189
But I found it ridiculous so that I didn't tell you.

384
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,309
Our men out of the palace also brought us some news.

385
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:44,829
Xiao Jinyu's Chief Guardsman Wu Jiang has been surreptitious lately.

386
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,690
We can't figure out what he's doing.

387
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:52,960
Did Xiao Jinyu not close Yang Ming's case

388
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,730
because of Duke Chang?

389
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,009
You sound more ridiculous.

390
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:02,969
They're risking their necks!

391
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,870
What the hell!

392
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,950
Duke Chang?

393
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:13,040
He's been dead for so many years.

394
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,070
Why is he suddenly brought up again?

395
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,560
Go check in the palace

396
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,810
and find out who started such rumors.

397
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,900
Go!

398
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:36,759
Did Xiao Jinyu go to Qianzhou for another reason?

399
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:40,519
[Princess Xiping's Mansion]

400
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,610
Your Highness, over the past years, I haven't had a mother.

401
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:49,760
Because of that, a lot of people bullied me.

402
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:56,359
Now I know who my mother is, though I am not familiar with her.

403
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:57,860
But when I know where she is,

404
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,059
I feel quite relieved after being confused for such a long time.

405
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:04,490
Thank you, Your Highness.

406
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:10,150
I know you want to find your father.

407
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,189
I promised Sir Witch Doctor that

408
00:24:12,189 --> 00:24:14,910
I wouldn't tell anyone else about him.

409
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:20,810
But now that you're his son, you're not anyone else.

410
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,679
You're right.

411
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,650
It's Sir Witch Doctor who told me the stories

412
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,800
and gave me the pendant.

413
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:41,719
I have nothing valuable, but this pendant.

414
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:43,449
I kept it for many years.

415
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:46,349
Now, I give it to you as a souvenir.

416
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,639
Souvenir? Why?

417
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,999
Sir Witch Doctor, you're leaving?

418
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,900
Where are you going?

419
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,059
Where can I go?

420
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:57,969
I'm not going anywhere.

421
00:24:57,969 --> 00:25:00,039
Keep it carefully.

422
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,740
I will keep it carefully.

423
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,519
Also, you must remember.

424
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,759
Do not...

425
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:07,909
I'll remember. I'll remember.

426
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,960
I won't tell anyone about you.

427
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,610
He went missing five years ago.

428
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,930
This is what he left me.

429
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:27,350
It's been five years and I've been keeping this letter.

430
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,280
[To Chu Chu]

431
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,900
Sir Witch Doctor?

432
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,969
Where is he?

433
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:42,260
I said I would come for another story.

434
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,760
[To Chu Chu]

435
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,759
Chu Chu, I'm going on a long trip for an emergency.

436
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,019
I didn't have time to bid farewell face to face.

437
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:01,289
Then I leave you this letter.

438
00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:03,529
Practice your skills carefully and believe that

439
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:05,399
you can achieve anything with efforts.

440
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,020
You'll become a coroner.

441
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,689
I had thought he would come back.

442
00:26:11,689 --> 00:26:14,579
But he hasn't come back yet.

443
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:18,129
When I was little, I believed that the Handsome Judge existed.

444
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,879
I want to bring him back.

445
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:23,109
I always think when I bring him back,

446
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,459
I'll know where Sir Witch Doctor has gone.

447
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:29,210
Your Highness, this is all I know.

448
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,999
Thank you for telling me this.

449
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,100
Can you find him with so little information?

450
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,800
I will find him.

451
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,750
I trust you.

452
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,320
Chu Chu.

453
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,739
Grandfather.

454
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:53,240
Your Highness, thank you for sparing us.

455
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,269
We don't know how to pay you back.

456
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:59,289
If you need any help, we'll help even at the risk to our lives.

457
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,290
Thank you, Sir.

458
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:08,000
Chu Chu, I have something for you.

459
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,860
This is what your mother carried.

460
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,850
When I put her in the coffin,

461
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:21,159
I asked someone to get it from your mother's bun.

462
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,179
I had planned to give it to you at your wedding,

463
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,110
as if it were your mother's gift.

464
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,110
Now that you already know,

465
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,000
I'd like to give it to you now.

466
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,520
Thank you, Grandfather.

467
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,760
May I have a look?

468
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,529
I don't know much about your mother.

469
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:52,790
No one talked about her before.

470
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,580
I took a quick look at her

471
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:01,169
on the night she was buried.

472
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:06,250
She looked pretty and fair-skinned.

473
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:12,200
Obviously, she was from a rich family, but she looked a bit thinner.

474
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:18,080
I guess she had suffered a lot

475
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,330
after her husband died.

476
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:29,149
Chu Chu, anyway, she carried you for months

477
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,389
so that you came into this world.

478
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,929
Though she tried to kill herself while carrying you,

479
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:38,909
she must have been in great trouble.

480
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:41,909
Don't hate her.

481
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:45,470
Don't worry, Grandfather.

482
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:49,109
My mother came all the way here, carrying me.

483
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,359
I'm sure she wanted to give birth to me.

484
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,139
No matter what happened, she was my mother for months.

485
00:28:55,139 --> 00:28:56,599
I didn't know this before.

486
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,289
But now I do.

487
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:03,610
I'll keep her in my mind carefully.

488
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,179
You've grown up, Chu Chu.

489
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:08,819
Don't worry, Grandfather.

490
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:12,940
All right. All right.

491
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,290
Chu Chu.

492
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:21,279
Besides this hairpin, is there anything else from Chu Chu's mother?

493
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:27,730
The Xu family told us that all her stuff had to be buried with her.

494
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,409
Your Highness, are you looking for some clues?

495
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:32,469
No.

496
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,099
I was just asking.

497
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:36,460
Don't bother about it.

498
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,329
All right. All right.

499
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:59,639
Your Highness, are you drawing this hairpin?

500
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,959
Why?

501
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,020
It doesn't look like something from an ordinary family.

502
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,449
But I know very little about girls' things.

503
00:30:10,449 --> 00:30:13,359
I'm drawing it and then will ask people in the capital to investigate it.

504
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,309
Maybe we'll find some clues about your parents.

505
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:18,479
About my parents?

506
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,959
Don't you want to know who your father is?

507
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,479
Don't you want to know what he had suffered

508
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,960
that made your mother come all the way here?

509
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,819
My father died of disaster, didn't he?

510
00:30:30,819 --> 00:30:34,650
Your Highness, what are you suspecting?

511
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:37,130
I simply feel a bit confused.

512
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:41,929
When you were born, there wasn't any natural disaster in Jiannan

513
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,700
that could ruin a whole clan.

514
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,489
So, it couldn't be a disaster like a flood or an earthquake.

515
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:52,109
It was more likely to be a man-caused disaster.

516
00:30:52,109 --> 00:30:54,779
Man-caused? What do you mean?

517
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,019
Calm down.

518
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,289
I'm simply guessing.

519
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,810
After we find out who your parents are, we'll know the truth.

520
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:06,529
Later, go to the government office with me to check the household register.

521
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,329
Now that the Xu family is a big family,

522
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,239
there must be a detailed record.

523
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,399
We can easily check out who your mother married.

524
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,759
If there's something fishy with your father's death,

525
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,120
I'll figure it out.

526
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,970
Thank you, Your Highness.

527
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,511
Now that Sir Witch Doctor is your father,

528
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:31,649
do you know where Six Gates is and who the Handsome Judge is?

529
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:32,759
What?

530
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,630
Shortly after you work for me,

531
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,979
you want to go somewhere else and find another job?

532
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,979
No, no.

533
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,690
I really want to work for you.

534
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:46,199
However good the Handsome Judge is, he isn't you.

535
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,729
He never said I was the best coroner.

536
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:51,449
He didn't rush into the fire, regardless of his own safety.

537
00:31:51,449 --> 00:31:54,879
He didn't make autopsy tools for me.

538
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,549
He didn't live in my home without any unwillingness

539
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,841
or treat my family as his own family.

540
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:05,619
I know this isn't what a judge must do for a coroner.

541
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:08,520
You did all this for me.

542
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,329
Looks like I can't let you play around with Jing Yi or Leng Yue.

543
00:32:16,329 --> 00:32:20,199
After so few days, they've made you thick-skinned.

544
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,680
Anyway, I know you're nice to me.

545
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,159
Very nice to me.

546
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:30,430
Your Highness, I won't work for anyone else, unless you expel me!

547
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:35,249
Then why do you still want to find Six Gates and the Handsome Judge?

548
00:32:35,249 --> 00:32:39,949
I... I'm simply curious to know more.

549
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:43,949
When I was little, Sir Witch Doctor told me stories about Six Gates.

550
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:47,109
If it weren't for finding the Handsome Judge

551
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,689
or being a coroner in Six Gates,

552
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,949
I wouldn't have been brave enough to go to Chang'an.

553
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,130
I wouldn't have met you, either.

554
00:32:56,190 --> 00:33:00,799
Also, you look so much like the Handsome Judge.

555
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,469
But you're right.

556
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:08,739
When I first heard his story, I was six years old.

557
00:33:08,739 --> 00:33:11,839
You were also a child then.

558
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,659
You can't be the Handsome Judge.

559
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,020
Even if Sir Witch Doctor is your father,

560
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:20,999
he wouldn't know what you would look like.

561
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,699
That's odd.

562
00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:25,020
It's not odd.

563
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:28,009
Just some coincidences.

564
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:29,159
Coincidences?

565
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,099
I read carefully the notes you gave me.

566
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:36,020
I had read about many stories before that.

567
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,949
But when I read about them, they were not legends,

568
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,369
but real recorded cases.

569
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,709
Really?

570
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,559
Who solved the cases, then?

571
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,920
He's the constable, isn't he?

572
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,559
No.

573
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,909
My father solved the cases when he served as a censor.

574
00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:00,510
- Then isn't he the...?
- He isn't.

575
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:05,500
I guess the Handsome Judge is a man

576
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,769
my father expected to exist in this world.

577
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:11,810
What do you mean?

578
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,589
You asked me why I knew what the Handsome Judge said.

579
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:21,420
I read about them in some old notes my father left me.

580
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:27,550
The Ten Commandment Hall was set up according to the record in his notes.

581
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,319
The Handsome Judge you admire...

582
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,030
I guess he's the ideal judge in my father's heart

583
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:40,140
and he's that kind of man my father wants all judges to be.

584
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,810
That explains it.

585
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:48,799
Sir Witch Doctor told me that all stories in Six Gates were real,

586
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,970
but he never wanted me to look for the Handsome Judge.

587
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,199
Your Highness, in my heart,

588
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,520
you're the best judge that other judges should imitate.

589
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:06,760
Keep the hairpin carefully.

590
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,140
[Jiangshan Hall]

591
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,160
What...?

592
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,950
Your Majesty, what happened?

593
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,440
- What's the time now?
- Your Majesty, it's nearly midnight.

594
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,630
Time to go to bed.

595
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,669
Go get me some tea.

596
00:35:50,669 --> 00:35:53,770
I'll go to bed after completing this.

597
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

598
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:13,190
Master, what do you think happened?

599
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:16,050
Why was His Majesty so scared?

600
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,440
He was so scared possibly

601
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,260
because he heard that Duke Chang might still be alive.

602
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:30,559
I thought His Majesty was wise.

603
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:37,149
At first, almost everyone in the palace thought he was insane.

604
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:41,359
Even Eunuch Ma didn't see him through and was kept in ignorance.

605
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:47,699
Only the late emperor thought His Majesty was pretending to be insane.

606
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:51,729
He then tried every possible means to kill His Majesty.

607
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:56,459
Unexpectedly, His Majesty took the throne at last.

608
00:36:56,459 --> 00:37:00,949
Everything that the late emperor predicted came true.

609
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:03,349
Did His Majesty dream that

610
00:37:03,349 --> 00:37:06,539
the late emperor's son Duke Chang came back to life

611
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:09,220
and would take back the throne?

612
