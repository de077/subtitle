00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,250
His Highness has poor health,

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,519
yet he stayed up all night to make autopsy tools for me.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,720
You made these with your own hands?

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,840
He even took me to investigate the case.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,019
But I don't know what my brother was thinking.

7
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:24,159
Why couldn't he get along with His Highness?

8
00:00:24,159 --> 00:00:28,079
And why must he take His Highness to the witch doctor's house to catch the ghost?

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,750
Indeed, they've caught the ghost,

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,170
but they discovered a body, a eunuch's body.

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,600
What secret does Sir Witch Doctor hide?

00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:16,140
[Episode 12]

14
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,779
Multiple wounds caused by sharp weapons on the body.

15
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,979
The cuts are small and shallow.

16
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,289
The lethal injury was an upward stab from the fifth rib on the left

17
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,989
through the heart and to the upper left of the back.

18
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:36,899
The murder weapon should be a hard cylindrical object

19
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,990
with a sharp point.

20
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,779
- Like...
- Like this.

21
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,939
Yes, like...

22
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,749
No, not like this.

23
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,010
This is the murder weapon.

24
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,896
This is the murder weapon?

25
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,749
The murder weapon and the body were preserved together.

26
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,470
What was the purpose of the one who hid the body?

27
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:03,760
Oh, right!  If this iron rod is the murder weapon, what is that blade for?

28
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,350
The positions of the wounds are very strange.

29
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,610
- What do you mean?
- Most of the injuries were on the forearms,

30
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,629
belly, and upper part of the thighs.
[Wound positions]

31
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,989
The lethal injury at the top was stabbed upwards.

32
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:20,779
[In | Out]

33
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,189
What's so strange about that?

34
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,089
The dead was a martial artist.

35
00:03:25,089 --> 00:03:29,139
If one were to kill him, the murderer would also be a good fighter.

36
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,019
Wait!  How do you know that he was a martial artist?

37
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,039
Miss Leng told me that martial artists know when to yield.

38
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,889
It means when they know they have to get injured,

39
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:40,939
they know the level of their own injuries.

40
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,779
The non-lethal injuries on this person are long and shallow.

41
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,729
Because when the murder weapon cut his skin, he drew himself back

42
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,989
from deep cuts, which could cause heavy damage.

43
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,190
That's true.

44
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,420
But there's nothing strange about it.

45
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,019
The murderer is someone who could kill a martial artist,

46
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,419
then he should attack the vital parts.

47
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,399
For example, head and throat.

48
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:11,880
But the murderer didn't do so.

49
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,529
Girl, is this what you're trying to say?

50
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:17,159
Yes.

51
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:23,370
But... it's not like the murderer didn't want to, he just couldn't.

52
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,800
Your Highness.

53
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,530
Tell me.

54
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,259
Other than the lethal injury, the rest of the wounds are shallow.

55
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,509
The deepest is 5-centimeters deep.

56
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,369
However, the iron rod is at least 60-centimeters long.

57
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:52,139
It means the murderer and the dead didn't have a close fight.

58
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:57,550
They kept about 60-centimeters away from each other.

59
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,289
The dead has a wound on the right forearm,

60
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:05,500
which was stabbed upwards from left to right.

61
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,308
Cut my neck from the left.

62
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,079
The dead has another wound on the right thigh,

63
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,860
which was cut downwards.

64
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,240
And the wound on the belly was cut from left to right.

65
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,650
The lethal injury was an upward stab.

66
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,439
What are you doing? Don't take advantage of my sister.

67
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,369
Get up!

68
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,039
Calm down. I didn't say your sister took advantage of my brother.

69
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,629
Shoo!

70
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,869
Brother, I was being rude.

71
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,810
Brother, we're trying to make an inference of how the person was murdered

72
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,519
and how the murderer acted.

73
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,340
I played the dead, he played the murderer.

74
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,960
Somehow, something felt strange in our inference.

75
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,839
The wounds on the dead are at the same height, the same side.

76
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,450
And judging from his height,

77
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,799
the murderer's attacks were so low as if he were a child.

78
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,349
But a child wouldn't have the strength.

79
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:15,580
If the murderer was kneeling or lying down,

80
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,170
that would make sense.

81
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,339
What sense?

82
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:19,799
Nonsense, in my opinion.

83
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,909
It wasn't a friendly match.

84
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,200
The murderer could just get up and cut his throat, couldn't he?

85
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,700
Why the extra steps? He just wanted to take advantage of you.

86
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,080
You...

87
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,920
I couldn't figure that out as well.

88
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,579
It's not that he didn't want to get up, he couldn't.

89
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,280
He couldn't?

90
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,189
- Do you mean...
- Sir Witch Doctor?

91
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:50,139
His leg is injured. He can't stand up.

92
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:54,170
So you mean the suspect is... Sir Witch Doctor?

93
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:57,129
No way. Why would he murder someone?

94
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:59,019
Didn't you see how they moved?

95
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,199
The eunuch wanted to kill him.

96
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,649
He fought the eunuch back to keep himself alive.

97
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:05,099
It wasn't his fault.

98
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,229
No, Sir Witch Doctor didn't do it on purpose.

99
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:11,050
Hadn't he killed the eunuch, he would have been dead.

100
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,249
Yes.

101
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:14,949
It was a justifiable homicide.

102
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,219
Why didn't he go to the law enforcement?

103
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:20,019
If he didn't want others to know, he could've buried the body.

104
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:22,889
Why would he spend so much effort keeping the body well-preserved

105
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:27,419
and hide the murder weapon and the body in the wall?

106
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,809
He did this because he was trying to keep the evidence.

107
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:33,719
Keep the evidence?

108
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,129
The evidence of the murder he committed?

109
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:43,100
Chu Chu, you said you heard a ghost's cry in this house on a random day when you were little,

110
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,019
then people said it was haunted.

111
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,000
Can you remember when it started exactly?

112
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,840
I can't.

113
00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:56,827
I do.

114
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,539
My father and I helped Sir Witch Doctor build the walls.

115
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,689
Right after the walls were built, the house was haunted.

116
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:07,190
My father felt bad about it at that time.

117
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,299
He must have kept the evidence for some reason.

118
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,789
But he didn't want other eunuchs to find it,

119
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:20,510
so he kept the body and the murder weapon in the wall.

120
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,069
Also, because it's windy at night,

121
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:27,150
he made it a so-called haunted house.

122
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,749
A witch doctor's business is related to ghosts and spirits anyway.

123
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,419
His living in a haunted house makes sense to common civilians.

124
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,900
The civilians fear but won't doubt it.

125
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,489
But Sir Witch Doctor never mentioned that he had enemies.

126
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:45,859
We never saw anyone come to seek revenge on him.

127
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,940
Should we go to law enforcement?

128
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,510
I'm a law enforcer.

129
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,149
Since the dead was a eunuch,

130
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,339
the imperial palace needs to investigate it.

131
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,749
Listen up, the three of you.

132
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,049
Without my permission, none of you is allowed

133
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:02,150
to tell anyone about what happened tonight.

134
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,930
Especially you.

135
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,660
- It's late.
- Let's go.

136
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,320
Collect the evidence and take it back.

137
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,060
Father.

138
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,979
Chu Chu, where were you in the middle of the night?

139
00:09:31,979 --> 00:09:34,809
I went to get some wine, you were all gone when I came back.

140
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:36,950
I wanted to go out to find you.

141
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,609
I'm a bad drinker, I wanted some fresh air,

142
00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:44,290
so I asked them out for a walk with me.

143
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,339
For causing you worry,

144
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,619
it was inconsiderate of me.

145
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:50,000
No, no. I'm glad you're okay.

146
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,450
Where is Chu He and the general?

147
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,509
My brother took General Xiao for a walk at the back.

148
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,149
They'll be back soon.

149
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,589
They didn't go to the hill, did they?

150
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,899
It's been raining on and off these days, they mustn't go to the hill.

151
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,829
No, they haven't. Father, don't worry.

152
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,530
They'll be back soon.

153
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,559
Well, is the table cleaned up?

154
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,439
Not yet.

155
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:14,789
Let's go clean up the table and go to bed afterward.

156
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:16,960
Please rest early.

157
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,199
- Your Highness.
- Follow me.

158
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:36,590
Yes.

159
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,200
Quickly, this way.

160
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,900
Put him in it.

161
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,629
The coffin hasn't been here for years.

162
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:08,330
No one claims it.

163
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,249
You keep on the watch here.

164
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:16,550
Yes.

165
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,330
[Archive]

166
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,530
Chu He,

167
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,410
where were you and General Xiao in the middle of the night?

168
00:12:13,017 --> 00:12:16,387
Father, do you remember the wall

169
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,849
that you helped the witch doctor build in the summer?

170
00:12:19,849 --> 00:12:21,149
Yes.

171
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,709
He said the walls were too old

172
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,949
and that he was afraid that they'd collapse in the rainy season.

173
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,900
I heightened and thickened the walls in accordance with his requirements.

174
00:12:29,968 --> 00:12:31,048
Why are you asking me this?

175
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:39,950
Father, Sir Witch Doctor killed someone,

176
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,110
and hid the body in the wall.

177
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,739
What?

178
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,389
The officer in charge of criminal cases from Chang'an found it out.

179
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:53,749
I thought he was a phony, so I wanted to humble him

180
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,949
with the haunted house, but he actually figured it out.

181
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,400
The ghost is in the wall.

182
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,539
The officer also said that it mustn't be leaked

183
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,690
and that the leaker would be punished.

184
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,859
Why are you telling me this, then?

185
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,629
You serve in the Yamen, how can you make this mistake?

186
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:17,219
Because I haven't been clear about his true identity.

187
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,539
What if he's fooling around with us?

188
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,539
If Lord Zheng knows and blames it on us, what do we do, then?

189
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,460
We're the coroners of Guanling County.

190
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,670
It isn't a small thing. Don't mess around.

191
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,629
I'll pry for information from the Yamen tomorrow.

192
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:42,340
Let's find out who the officer is first.

193
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,899
It doesn't matter if he's from Chang'an

194
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,560
or he's in charge of criminal cases,

195
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,829
he's the real deal.

196
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:57,540
I feel like he's insightful.

197
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,590
He can't stay in our house for long.

198
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,149
Is he suspicious of Chu Chu?

199
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,629
I don't know.

200
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,149
But she told me that the officer would

201
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,829
personally investigate her identity.

202
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:15,410
If he found it out, Chu Chu's life would be over.

203
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,909
How about this?

204
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:26,710
I'll take her away.

205
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,709
Nonsense. Where are you taking her to?

206
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,171
If you take her away now,

207
00:14:30,171 --> 00:14:32,589
you're telling him that there's something wrong with Chu Chu.

208
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:35,850
I'll break your leg if you mess around.

209
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,269
Go to work.

210
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,770
Now.

211
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,630
Your Highness. General Xiao.

212
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,749
My house can't compete with those in Chang'an,

213
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:02,459
but all the bedding is new, and the table and chairs are cleaned up.

214
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,290
Don't worry, they're all clean.

215
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,389
Brother, I'd like to speak to Chu Chu in private.

216
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,290
I'll excuse myself, then.

217
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,589
Your Highness, your brother is so nice.

218
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,559
He listens to everything that you say.

219
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:22,659
He thinks everything that you do is right.

220
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,639
No, he doesn't take orders from me,

221
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,149
I've just been spoiled by him since I was little.

222
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,949
My brother spoils me, too.

223
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,779
But he thinks everything that I say is nonsense

224
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,049
and everything that I do is messing-around.

225
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:36,629
The witch doctor encouraged you, didn't he?

226
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,269
Why do you bring him up again?

227
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:42,140
Are you going to ask more questions about the case?

228
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,849
Chu Chu, what we discovered tonight matters a lot.

229
00:15:46,849 --> 00:15:50,290
It's come this far, won't you tell me the truth?

230
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:55,940
Your Highness, you have questions about Sir Witch Doctor. Right?

231
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,709
I've told you the truth.

232
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,639
Sir Witch Doctor is a good man.

233
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,099
I really don't know where he is right now.

234
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,590
You know I'm not talking about that.

235
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:14,790
Your pendant was handmade by my father.

236
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,189
The pendants are the tokens of love between my father and mother.

237
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,170
This is my mother's.

238
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:28,835
It pairs with the one in your hand.

239
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,880
When I first saw the pendant,

240
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,690
I knew that you had clues about my father.

241
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,149
This is the only lead for me to find him.

242
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:44,859
Chu Chu, can you tell me where you got the pendant?

243
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,900
So it is the pendant that you care about.

244
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,140
Your Highness, there has never been a second test. Right?

245
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,369
You never wanted to hire me.

246
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,659
You kept me at your side because

247
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,009
you were investigating the pendant. Right?

248
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,979
You never thought of me as the best coroner.

249
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,131
The purpose of your praises and compliments is this pendant, right?

250
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:06,918
Chu Chu.

251
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,679
You can seize and interrogate me.

252
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,909
Don't coax me like this.

253
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:12,510
No.

254
00:17:21,492 --> 00:17:23,008
What's wrong, Jinyu?

255
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,649
Let's count the days.

256
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,319
It was four years after the rebellion of the Military Commissioner of Jiannan

257
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,170
that the eunuch showed up.

258
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,529
What happened back then couldn't be that simple.

259
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:36,169
Our father didn't return to the capital city,

260
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:38,420
didn't contact Chang'an,

261
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,999
didn't contact the imperial garrison in the southwest.

262
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:44,079
This matter must be one of the reasons.

263
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,679
I know that.

264
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,380
I mean...

265
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,340
What's wrong with Miss Chu?

266
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,029
Up all night? What have you been doing?

267
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,309
Looking for the tomb of Chu Chu's biological mother.

268
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,150
Looking for the tomb?

269
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,149
Both His Highness and I think

270
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,309
that the tomb of Chu Chu's biological mother

271
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,409
is among the tombs that the Chu family often pays respects to.

272
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:23,509
But the Chu family pays respects to

273
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:25,859
every dead one that they examined or encoffined.

274
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,180
All my night has been spent on that.

275
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,329
Have you found anything?

276
00:18:31,329 --> 00:18:33,030
No.

277
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,699
Eat something first, then.

278
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,359
You drank so much last night, you should eat something for breakfast.

279
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:45,000
What are these? Are these just for me?

280
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,510
What's your problem?

281
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,199
Are you going to eat them or what?

282
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:50,599
I'll take them away.

283
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,400
I will.

284
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,549
Your Highness says you aren't allowed to eat while reviewing the case records.

285
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,310
Are you challenging me?

286
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,760
Fine. I'll go tell His Highness.

287
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,079
[January 9, the tenth year of Taihe reign]

288
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,680
Wait.

289
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,360
No.

290
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,060
Out of my way!

291
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,529
Greetings, Your Grace.

292
00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:39,430
What are you doing here?

293
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,180
Your Grace,

294
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:48,459
His Majesty knows it's the anniversary of the Prince Consort's death

295
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:52,530
and ordered me to pay respects.

296
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:58,249
- Ma, put the offerings on the table.
- Yes.

297
00:19:58,249 --> 00:20:00,650
Who dares to take a step further!

298
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,549
Your Grace, years have passed.

299
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,229
Are you still holding a grudge

300
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:16,260
because I didn't take the Prince Consort back?

301
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,749
Grudge?

302
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,129
Eunuch Qin, stop thinking highly of yourself.

303
00:20:21,129 --> 00:20:23,940
You don't deserve my grudge.

304
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,939
How magnanimous of you.

305
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,940
Had I done a good job at the time,

306
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,360
Commandery Prince An wouldn't need to go to the southwest,

307
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,240
where rebellions often break out.

308
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,260
Commandery Prince An travels lightly.

309
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,300
I've been worrying about him.

310
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,950
Listen!  If you dare touch my son,

311
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,110
I'll make sure you die horribly.

312
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,810
You see!  You see!  What are you talking about, Your Grace?

313
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:03,549
I spend all my time serving His Majesty in the palace.

314
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:08,239
How is it possible for me to touch Commandery Prince An?

315
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:11,390
- Nonsense!
- What's wrong?

316
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:14,149
Hasn't Commandery Prince An

317
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:17,550
sent his regards to you after he left the capital city for a month?

318
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,550
Eunuch Qin.

319
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,640
Your Grace.

320
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,699
Lord Xue.

321
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,799
What? Are you here to pay respects to the Prince Consort as well?

322
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:35,840
I'm here on behalf of His Majesty.

323
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,810
However, Her Grace doesn't seem to appreciate His Majesty's concerns.

324
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,509
How strange.

325
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:52,029
I, too, was ordered to pay respects on behalf of His Majesty.

326
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:55,479
He ordered me to take four fruits of the season

327
00:21:55,479 --> 00:22:00,360
to put before the memorial tablet.

328
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,459
Since His Majesty has ordered you here,

329
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,650
why did he ask me to do the same?

330
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:15,339
Uh, uh... I guess His Majesty must have forgotten that he sent me.

331
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,309
Since you reject his goodwill,

332
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:23,340
I'll have to go back and tell His Majesty so.

333
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,029
Farewell.  Goodbye.

334
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,769
Come. Back to the palace.

335
00:22:28,769 --> 00:22:30,710
Duke Qin, walk carefully.

336
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,219
Lord Xue.

337
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,389
Congratulations on your promotion to War Minister.

338
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,670
You won't have to speak behind the folding screen

339
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:49,470
in Jiangshan Hall.

340
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,630
Congratulations. Congratulations.

341
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,290
Let's go.

342
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,019
Quickly.

343
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:07,289
Your Grace, His Majesty asked me to bring these.

344
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:09,700
I thank His Majesty's concerns.

345
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,290
I haven't congratulated you

346
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,769
on your promotion yet.

347
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:20,099
Don't tease me, Your Grace.

348
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,649
I'm incompetent.

349
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:25,469
I undertake the responsibility with great humility.

350
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:28,059
I fear that I might not live up to His Majesty's trust.

351
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:32,039
Senior Jing said a long time ago that you were a man of great talent.

352
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:35,019
You don't pursue fame, but have greatness in your heart.

353
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:37,179
You will be given a peerage in no time.

354
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,659
You speak to highly of me, Your Grace.

355
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:43,060
- Master, you're back.
- Shut up!

356
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,939
What happened...?

357
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,220
Bastard! Bastard!

358
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:04,029
You... Why do you bring the food for the dead into the room?!

359
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,689
Toss it out to feed the dog! Feed the dogs!

360
00:24:06,689 --> 00:24:07,819
Idiots!

361
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,899
- Out! Out! Quickly!
- Yes, yes!

362
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:11,550
Out!

363
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,569
Master, did the widow upset you again?

364
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:18,480
Calm down. Watch your health.

365
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:24,439
Xue Rucheng has Jing Zhi and the Xiaos backing him up.

366
00:24:24,439 --> 00:24:29,789
He becomes arrogant right after being promoted to Minister of War by throwing my surname at me.

367
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,780
Who does he think he is?

368
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,809
A poor and pedantic scholar who crawled into the imperial palace

369
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:39,140
dares to mess with me?

370
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:46,439
A disgrace! A disgrace!

371
00:24:46,439 --> 00:24:48,919
Master, calm down.

372
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:51,959
Even if he's in charge of ten ministries,

373
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:54,789
he's still a pathetic scholar.

374
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:57,280
If he disgusts you, just say the word,

375
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,509
I'll find someone and make sure he disappears before tomorrow sunrise.

376
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,910
You...

377
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,029
You promised me the disappearance of many people!

378
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,500
Answer me!  It's been so long,

379
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,240
what has Xu Rugui accomplished?

380
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,950
Where's the head of Xiao Jinyu?

381
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,150
What about the female coroner?

382
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,709
Master, when Xu Rugui ambushed Xiao Jinyu in Qianzhou,

383
00:25:21,709 --> 00:25:25,049
Xiao Jinyu happened to lead the Qianzhou garrison there.

384
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:28,490
The ambush failed and Xu Rugui lost half of his men.

385
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,840
He's useless!

386
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,259
Master, please don't be mad.

387
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:40,799
Xu Rugui has now made a new ambush plan, which is a guarantee to success.

388
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,900
When the good news comes back, you'll be the first to know.

389
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,770
You know what? It feels quite strange.

390
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:08,749
The wood itself isn't scary, but once it's made into a coffin,

391
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,559
it becomes pretty creepy.

392
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,699
When the arms and legs are on a human, they aren't creepy.

393
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,840
When they're amputated, they become creepy.

394
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,149
You shouldn't say this around all these coffins.

395
00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:22,459
The good thing is, the coffins are all empty.

396
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,339
Who says they are all empty?

397
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,140
This one isn't.

398
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,269
Don't try to scare me.

399
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:32,029
No coffin-maker would use a dead body to try a coffin out.

400
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:34,610
From my years of experience,

401
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:37,949
the coffin must have been used as a storage box.

402
00:26:37,949 --> 00:26:39,790
Don't believe me? Let's have a look.

403
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,010
What is it? So well covered.

404
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,339
Don't touch it!

405
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,699
Stop howling.

406
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,899
You've seen corpses before.

407
00:26:54,899 --> 00:26:56,899
What's wrong with those Chu people?

408
00:26:56,899 --> 00:26:58,439
Why did you put a dead body in it?

409
00:26:58,439 --> 00:27:00,129
Where should a dead body be if it isn't in a coffin?

410
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:01,659
Watch your hand!

411
00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:04,089
The Chu family didn't put it in the coffin, I did.

412
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,120
You did?

413
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,609
This is an important piece of evidence.

414
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:10,810
You must figure a way to bring it back to the Yamen later.

415
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,270
Speak. What's the matter?

416
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,749
I got Chu Chu's background.

417
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,350
What?

418
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,659
This is what I found yesterday in the archive.

419
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:27,140
A suicide case in a large family.

420
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,219
The dead was the younger sister of the master of the Xu family

421
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,389
in Guanling County, who had been married.

422
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:35,099
His sister came to Guanling County, seeking refuge under him for some reason.

423
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:37,940
The brother and sister had a fight and she then committed suicide.

424
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,269
Why does it have anything to do with Chu Chu?

425
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,049
Check the date.

426
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:45,289
[January 9, the tenth year of Taihe reign]

427
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,190
January 9?

428
00:27:52,031 --> 00:27:56,239
[January 9]
The case record says, Chu Ping collected Mrs. Xu's body.

429
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:58,389
He buried her on that very night.

430
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,930
So,

431
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:04,360
Chu Ping took a body on Chu Chu's birthday.

432
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,249
Yes. In my opinion,

433
00:28:07,249 --> 00:28:12,740
Chu Chu is the abandoned baby that Chu Ping took in when he buried Mrs. Xu.

434
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,430
Abandoned baby?

435
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,439
Your Highness, abandoned babies are common in the southwest.

436
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:22,179
The land is barren in the southwest, and natural disasters often happen.

437
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:24,060
When life becomes too difficult,

438
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,429
a family throws away the youngest kid.

439
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,009
Especially girls.

440
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:32,649
They are often dumped in graveyards and let fate make the decision.

441
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:34,589
If a kind-hearted visitor sees the baby,

442
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,070
they may take her home and raise her.

443
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,800
If not, she's just another dead body in the graveyard.

444
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,059
Mrs. Xu should have been pregnant when she killed herself.

445
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,959
Yes.

446
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:50,729
I wonder how serious the fight between them was?

447
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:54,499
Why would a pregnant woman kill herself by desperately hitting her head on the wall?

448
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,740
Two lives!

449
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,769
How come the record is so brief?

450
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:01,789
What was Mrs. Xu's full name? Who was her husband?

451
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:04,199
What did she and her brother fight about?

452
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:06,979
None of these is recorded when it got archived.

453
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:12,219
Last night, Zheng Youde told me that the archive had a fire.

454
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,109
The old records were all burned down.

455
00:29:14,109 --> 00:29:16,530
These were re-recorded after the fire.

456
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,789
Does the Chu family pay respects to Mrs. Xu?

457
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,729
Yes.

458
00:29:22,729 --> 00:29:27,159
The Chu family pays respects to anyone that they encoffined or examined.

459
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:29,440
Mrs. Xu was one of them.

460
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,509
Are you trying to...

461
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,010
You go back to the Yamen.

462
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,170
She's rude.

463
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,079
Excuse me.

464
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:05,359
I'd like to ask you some questions.

465
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:07,460
Come in, please.

466
00:30:13,328 --> 00:30:15,628
Mr. Chu,

467
00:30:15,628 --> 00:30:20,051
this is the case record that I asked my man to find in the Yamen.

468
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:25,159
The record says you took care of the dead body in this case.

469
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,140
Please have a look. Any impression?

470
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,100
[Mrs. Xu...]

471
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,330
So?

472
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,560
Yes.

473
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:53,079
The record is too brief.

474
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:57,620
Please recall the details of that day for me.

475
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,489
According to the case record,

476
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:03,799
Mrs. Xu had been pregnant when she hit the wall to kill herself.

477
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:07,629
Since you took care of her body, you should know

478
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:11,690
how far along she was.

479
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,679
Over eight months.

480
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:23,899
Nearly nine months.

481
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,019
- So she was near the time of labor.
- Yes.

482
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:28,439
Why do you ask this?

483
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:30,439
She's been dead for many years.

484
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:32,140
Chu He.

485
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,039
Yes, Mrs. Xu has been dead for many years,

486
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,450
what about the baby in her?

487
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,079
To be honest, when I first met Chu Chu in Chang'an,

488
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,769
I admired her skills and wished to hire her,

489
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:56,749
so I asked my men to investigate her background.

490
00:31:56,749 --> 00:32:00,879
I didn't understand what her birth was,

491
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:04,109
so that the family that raised her would rather let her be slandered

492
00:32:04,109 --> 00:32:08,489
by a bastard than defend her with the truth.

493
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:11,079
Now that I've seen the case record,

494
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,180
I finally understand the sad story behind it.

495
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,759
Chu Chu isn't a bastard,

496
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,070
nor is she an abandoned baby rescued in the graveyard.

497
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:26,749
She is the baby that you saved from Mrs. Xu's dead body.

498
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,080
The folks call them...

499
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,750
coffin babies.

500
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,059
Chu Chu.

501
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,869
Chu Chu, don't listen to him.

502
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,009
He's made it up. It's not true.

503
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:40,589
Chu Chu, follow me out.

504
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,590
Enough.

505
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:47,049
We've been hiding the truth from her, but we can't lie to her.

506
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:49,329
Chu Chu, you've grown up.

507
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:52,749
I need to tell you something.

508
00:32:52,749 --> 00:32:58,000
My Lord, she isn't my son's biological daughter.

509
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:06,660
But my son saved her and brought her back.

510
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,089
Since she was brought into our family,

511
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:12,570
I saw her as my granddaughter.

512
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:20,789
Father, I did it.

513
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:22,590
Let me speak.

514
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,300
My Lord.

515
00:33:25,835 --> 00:33:27,435
Father.

516
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:41,639
In the evening, January 9, an officer from the Yamen

517
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,150
asked me to collect a body from the Xu family.

518
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:48,213
The officer said the county magistrate had known her cause of death

519
00:33:48,213 --> 00:33:49,922
and that I didn't need to conduct an autopsy.
[Xu Family]

520
00:33:49,924 --> 00:33:53,684
Mr. Xu's sister killed herself by hitting her head against the wall.

521
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,189
It was still the new year period, the Xu family thought it was ominous

522
00:33:58,189 --> 00:34:01,330
and paid me to take away the body.

523
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,089
I didn't think too much

524
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:08,020
because Mrs. Xu did have an obvious bruise on her forehead.

525
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:14,430
The Xu family was cold-hearted, they just rolled her body in a straw mat.

526
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,330
I thought it was heartless, so I wanted to get her a proper coffin.

527
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,230
But something unexpected happened...

528
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,849
What's the matter?

529
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,190
Why are you holding a baby?

530
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,490
Father, look.

531
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:37,179
Father, she just died.

532
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,289
She was about to give birth.

533
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:41,480
I thought this baby...

534
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,119
I thought this baby could be saved, so I gave it a try.

535
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:46,569
And I did save her life.

536
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,499
It's a she.

537
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,609
Her life is strong.

538
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,770
I'm sure she'll have good fortune.

539
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,259
Who was she?

540
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,680
Mr. Xu Zongfang's sister.

541
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,219
I heard that her husband's entire family was disastrously killed.

542
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,899
So she went to seek refuge under her brother.

543
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,119
But she wasn't welcomed by her brother and his wife.

544
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,179
The butler paid me twenty coppers to take the body away

545
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,870
and bury her at a random spot.

546
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:21,049
How about I send them a message and ask them to take the baby home?

547
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,769
What message? Take her home?

548
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:27,999
A dead woman gave birth to a baby in the coffin room in a coroner's house,

549
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:30,100
who would take the baby?

550
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,729
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right.

551
00:35:32,729 --> 00:35:36,259
It's January 9, Father. It's the Jade Emperor's birthday.

552
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,179
The baby has survived.

553
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,370
Maybe she has God's blessing.

554
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:47,659
How about we keep her in our home, and after the Lantern Festival,

555
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,120
when the new year is over, I'll speak to the Xu family.

556
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,810
After all, she's a half Xu.

557
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:58,979
Also, the Xu family is rich, They have enough food.

558
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,290
They can raise the baby.

559
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,179
She's a poor soul.

560
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,280
All right, all right.

561
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,949
We buried Mrs. Xu's body and after the Lantern Festival,

562
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,772
I visited the Xu family.

563
00:36:14,774 --> 00:36:17,809
I then knew that the entire family had escaped from trouble.

564
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:21,329
I didn't want the baby to be involved.

565
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,369
I didn't know what trouble they got themselves into,

566
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:26,739
but even Mr. Xu had to escape from it,

567
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,699
a newborn baby surely needed to be kept away from it.

568
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,089
So I didn't tell anyone about her.

569
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,389
After all, the baby did nothing wrong.

570
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:38,799
So I brought her up as my own daughter.

571
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:42,360
I've heard all kinds of rumors.

572
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:46,709
Some say she's a bastard that my mistress and I had.

573
00:36:46,709 --> 00:36:50,359
Some say I picked her up in the graveyard.

574
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:53,909
But like you said, My Lord, it's better than letting people

575
00:36:53,909 --> 00:37:00,060
know a dead woman gave birth to her, a coffin baby.

576
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,219
My Lord, Mrs. Xu is dead.

577
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,559
She doesn't exist in this world anymore.

578
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:07,949
Chu Chu was born after her death.

579
00:37:07,949 --> 00:37:09,529
She shouldn't take the blame.

580
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,619
- My Lord.
- Sir, please don't.

581
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:16,870
If you convict us of hiding the truth, we plead guilty.

582
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:22,529
But Chu Chu has nothing to do with what that Xu family had done.

583
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:26,459
Don't blame anything on Chu Chu.

584
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,606
The pendant. He's after the pendant.

585
00:37:30,606 --> 00:37:31,949
The Chu family did nothing.

586
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,799
It's my fault. Don't punish them.

587
00:37:33,799 --> 00:37:35,699
You investigated my background and want to punish the Chu family

588
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,999
because you want to know more about the pendant.

589
00:37:37,999 --> 00:37:40,049
Whatever you want to know, ask me.

590
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:43,089
But please, don't punish the Chu family.

591
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,100
- Please!
- Is this your trust in me?

592
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,300
- Please!
- Is this how you trust me?!
