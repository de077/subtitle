Lord Jing said that I still had a chance

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,300
unless His Highness expelled me.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,931
He asked me to learn how to please His Highness.

5
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:18,300
I've made up my mind what to do.

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,820
But His Highness keeps asking about Uncle Witch Doctor.

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,710
Considering he's so smart,

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,700
if I keep working for him,'

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,250
I'm afraid I can no longer keep the secret.

[Two Merits Hall]

11
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,050
Take back your handkerchief.

12
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,780
How many identical handkerchiefs do you have?

13
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,719
Where are you going?

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,280
I'm going to the Palace.

[Episode 8]

17
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,429
No way. I can no longer stay here.

18
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,300
Where's my pass?

19
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,799
Qin Luan, that old fool!

20
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:53,089
How reckless he's getting!

21
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,469
He even dared to bully you like that!  I'm going to avenge you.

22
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:56,970
Ridiculous!

23
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,899
I... I'm being ridiculous under an order.

[To Leng Yue]

25
00:03:02,529 --> 00:03:03,729
Knowing I would arrive today,

26
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:06,099
Auntie asked someone to wait for me at the city gate with the letter.
[Princess Xiping]

27
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:08,389
She insisted that I should go to the tea gathering in the Palace.

28
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,769
I didn't mean to go. But now, I do.

29
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,900
Stop.

30
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,250
Your Highness! Your Highness!

31
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,860
Let her in.

32
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,639
- Your Highness.
- What happened?

33
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,370
My pass is missing.

34
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,449
Your pass is missing?

35
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:31,139
- When did you find it missing?
- Just now.

36
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:33,629
When I was packing my bag, I found it missing.

37
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,220
Why did suddenly pack your bag?

38
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,740
I...

39
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,260
I want to go home.

40
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,439
I didn't pass the selection exam.

41
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,059
And I've lost my tools.

42
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:53,650
I can do nothing here if I stay.

43
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,890
I want to go home, make new tools,

44
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,420
and practice harder before I come back again.

45
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,840
You failed the exam?

46
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,959
Your Highness, you're quite partial.

47
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,669
You even think highly of a useless man like Jing Yi.

48
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,459
She looks sincere. She must be a useful talent.

49
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,540
She won't be worst than Jing Yi.

50
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,820
Wait for me out there.

51
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,040
Everything will be fine, okay?

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,780
I'm going out for some business.

53
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,219
Go back to your room and look for your pass carefully.

54
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:30,900
If you still can't find it, when Wu Jiang comes back,

55
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,040
tell him how you found it missing and he will help you.

56
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,069
Silly girl. Don't try to find the Handsome Judge.

57
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:58,470
You can't find him in this world.

58
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,910
If you want to say something,

59
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,930
but no one listens to you,

60
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,460
look at the pendant and talk to it.

61
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,990
Pretend I am there listening to you.

62
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,110
I'll keep it carefully.

63
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,870
I believe

64
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,870
that you'll be the best coroner.

65
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,890
Also, you must remember.

66
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,069
- Do not—
- I remember. I remember.

67
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:28,770
I won't tell anyone about you.

68
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,460
I'll practice my skills carefully

69
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,930
and become the best coroner.

70
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,410
I will find the Handsome Judge.

71
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:45,280
Uncle Witch Doctor, I can no longer stay here.

72
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,320
But I can't leave without the pass.

73
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,310
Also, I don't want to leave.

74
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,490
Since I was born,

75
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,440
he's been the first man who allows me to perform an autopsy

76
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,690
and trusts me.

77
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,650
I want to work for him.

78
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,240
But he keeps asking about the pendant.

79
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:10,350
He even managed to portray you.

80
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:15,760
Uncle Witch Doctor, what do I do?

81
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,900
Should I keep doing what Lord Jing asked me to do?

82
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,070
I have something he's interested in.

83
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,519
Then why did he want General Wu to help me find my pass,

84
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,170
instead of asking me to stay?

85
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,730
Miss Chu.

86
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,999
General Wu.

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,240
Lian Qiao said you wanted to see me?

88
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,499
Yes. My pass is missing.

89
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:52,819
I can't find it at all.

90
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:56,380
His Highness asked me to tell you and said you would help me.

91
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,840
All right. I'll help with that.

92
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,669
But Miss Chu, shall we go to the Ten-Commandment Hall?

93
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,879
Ten-Commandment Hall?

94
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:06,269
Yes. His Highness wants you to do him a favor.

95
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,060
Do him a favor?

96
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,780
Is he going to let me stay?

97
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,700
[Fragrance Chamber]

98
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,760
[Fragrance Chamber]

99
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,349
Xiao Jinyu hasn't arrived yet?

100
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:56,800
Your Majesty, someone told me that Commandery Prince An had arrived.

101
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,039
Greetings, Your Highness.

102
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,109
General Zhou, are you waiting for someone?

103
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,999
There's some emergency in Shen Army

104
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,639
and I need to tell Eunuch Qin about it.

105
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,879
You mean a soldier in Shen Army was infected with pestilence

106
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,580
and died last night?

107
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,069
Such a small problem even disturbed you?

108
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,389
I'm ashamed of that.

109
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,610
How can pestilence be a small problem?

110
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,720
Shen Army is part of Imperial Armies.

111
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,589
There's pestilence in Shen Army.

112
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,229
If anything goes wrong and it spreads into the Palace,

113
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,310
can you take responsibility for it?

114
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,730
You're right, Your Highness.

115
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,140
I know this is very serious.

116
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,709
Last night, when it happened, I had the soldier taken out of town,

117
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,680
burned and buried deep, exactly according to military rules.

118
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,260
It's very efficient of you.

119
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,000
No wonder Eunuch Qin thinks highly of you.

120
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,920
I'm simply doing my duty.

121
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,700
Your Highness.

122
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,689
Your Highness, you said you were busy with work.

123
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:18,090
But now you're free enough to ask about a sick soldier.

124
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,520
You've done your work so quickly.

125
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,880
I really admire that.

126
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,500
But Your Highness,

127
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,580
Shen Army isn't under your charge.

128
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,660
Take care, Your Highness.

129
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,980
Take care, Your Highness.

130
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,079
Have you handled the problem?

131
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,529
Don't worry. The soldier was burned.

132
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,680
He wasn't burned to ash yet,

133
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,250
but no good skin remained.

134
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,370
Greetings, Your Highness.

135
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,979
I'm late. Please punish me.

136
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,879
Your Majesty, the tea's ready.

137
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,800
Please have a taste.

138
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,040
It's good.

139
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,710
Your Majesty, I've got something to say.

140
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,279
Your Majesty, Minister Feng loved tea before he died.

141
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,899
He was suddenly killed.

142
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:06,549
I've worked with him for years.

143
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,709
I can't help thinking of him. But look at Commandery Prince An.

144
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:13,800
He kept disturbing Minister Feng's home with a female coroner.

145
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,279
Last night, he even burned the mourning hall for Minister Feng

146
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,010
and nearly burned his body.

147
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:22,759
How can he take charge of Three Judicial Chief Ministries like that?

148
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,010
Please perceive it, Your Majesty.

149
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,310
Your Majesty, I was there last night.

150
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:39,569
Commandery Prince An went there to apologize, under your command.

151
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:41,080
There was simply a coincidence.

152
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,929
There can't be such a coincidence.

153
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:46,140
Everybody in Feng Manor witnessed that.

154
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,590
But His Highness nearly died in the fire, too.

155
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,100
Tell him to come over.

156
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,550
Please, Your Highness.

157
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,020
Your Majesty.

158
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,160
What happened last night?

159
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,460
Last night, someone set it on fire.

160
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,490
I'm still checking on the case.

161
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:20,299
But if the female coroner I took to the Feng Manor for an apology

162
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,940
hadn't risked her life to protect Feng Jie's corpse,

163
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,770
many truths would have been ruined.

164
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:30,439
Minister Han devotes himself to work and he watches out for danger

165
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,510
as a judge should do at any time.

166
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,560
Also, he doesn't follow me like sheep.

167
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,170
It's the luck of our nation.

168
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:44,080
It's also our luck when you give sympathetic consideration.

169
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,370
I've got something to say, too.

170
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,270
Someone was infected with pestilence?

171
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,899
How did you know, Miss Chu?

172
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:01,609
These are used for protection when contacting pestilence victims.

173
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:03,929
When I was little, there was pestilence in my hometown.

174
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:06,190
The magistrate sent men to teach us.

175
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,739
Oh, I remember.

176
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:11,300
When Manager Xu ran away yesterday, he was taken out in a carriage

177
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,879
where there was a dead man who died of pestilence.

178
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,180
You're right.

179
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,640
It was the burned corpse that was taken out of town in the carriage.

180
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,210
In Chang'an, no news has come about pestilence.

181
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:28,180
So, His Highness wants you to figure out

182
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,609
if this man died of pestilence.

183
00:14:30,609 --> 00:14:33,929
But there're many other coroners in Chang'an.

184
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:36,220
Why does His Highness want me?

185
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,460
His Highness said if you failed to figure out how this man died,

186
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,800
no other coroners in Chang'an would manage to do that.

187
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,110
He really said that?

188
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,850
He trusts my skills so much?

189
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,959
He also said that, even if the corpse was burned,

190
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,820
it didn't mean there is no danger.

191
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,099
If you have any concerns, you can refuse to inspect it.

192
00:14:57,099 --> 00:15:00,069
No. I have no concern at all. I'll inspect it.

193
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:01,229
Qin Luan.

194
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,530
Here.

195
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,689
Commandery Prince An told me that

196
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:08,590
a soldier in Shen Army was infected with pestilence, right?

197
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,709
For your information, Your Majesty, that's true.

198
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:15,390
I was just told, too.

199
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,029
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

200
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:21,879
The infected corpse was taken out of town immediately,

201
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,759
burned and buried deep.

202
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,320
It's such an important thing.

203
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,600
You simply burned the corpse?

204
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,959
Shen Army guards the Palace.

205
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,539
If you fail to figure out the real problem

206
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:36,439
and let the pestilence spread to the Palace, different ministries,

207
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,199
or even different parts of the capital,

208
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,380
can you take responsibility for it?

209
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,229
Don't get angry, Your Majesty.

210
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,909
I'll ask them to—

211
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,510
Don't bother.

212
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,099
I just asked the Imperial Insignia Guard

213
00:15:48,099 --> 00:15:50,879
to cooperate with the Imperial Medical Service

214
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,709
and seal off the battalion of Shen Army.

215
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,069
Those who took the corpse out of town last night should all be isolated.

216
00:15:57,069 --> 00:16:00,800
More decisions will be made accordingly in ten days.

217
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:07,279
I neglected my duty. Please punish me, Your Majesty.

218
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,880
All right.

219
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,080
Go to the battalion and keep an eye on epidemic prevention.

220
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,000
This way, Miss Chu.

221
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,380
Where are we?

222
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,970
His Highness said,

223
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,800
if you must take some tools for the autopsy,

224
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,000
you can choose some from these.

225
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,910
These are all made of steel.

226
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,300
By the way, General Wu, I want to ask.

227
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,490
Can I complete an autopsy this time?

228
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,739
His Highness said,

229
00:16:49,739 --> 00:16:53,089
coroners in Chang'an are not allowed to complete an autopsy without Permit of Autopsy,

230
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:55,690
or coroners will be sentenced.

231
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,689
This is the Permit of Autopsy with an official seal.

232
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:03,410
His Highness said that you can do whatever you want.

233
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,939
Moreover, His Highness asked you to fill in the autopsy sheet by yourself.

234
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,089
After you finish it,

235
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:09,639
I'll send the autopsy sheet to His Highness immediately.

236
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,679
Okay. General Wu, rest assured.

237
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,480
Take your time then.

238
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,429
I'm sorry to offend you at the Thought Chamber today.

239
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,460
Please forgive me.

240
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,810
This case is weird.

241
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,089
Please protect yourself carefully when investigating.

242
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:41,539
Be safe.

243
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:43,920
[Permit of Autopsy]

244
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,829
Xiao Jinyu.

245
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,829
Yes.

246
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,279
You did well in protecting Feng Jie's corpse,

247
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,040
but that's your responsibility.

248
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,009
You disturbed Feng Manor with a coroner. It's your fault.

249
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:01,039
Look, I heard you're good at making tea.

250
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,729
You can show it here.

251
00:18:02,729 --> 00:18:06,939
If you're really good at it, I won't punish you.

252
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:08,189
Yes.

253
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,060
Please allow me to make some preparations.

254
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,410
Please have a look.

255
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:56,179
I heard Commandery Prince An is good at painting.

256
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:59,530
Unexpectedly, he can make paintings with tea,

257
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:03,059
showing the scenery of the four seasons in these small cups.

258
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:04,779
How amazing!

259
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:09,430
Thanks to your Majesty, I can widen my horizon today.

260
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,920
Some talented persons in the palace can make paintings with tea, too.

261
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,470
But compared to yours, it's nothing at all.

262
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,699
Xiao Jinyu, what's in the box?

263
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:23,500
What's it for?

264
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,130
To be frank, Your Majesty, it's not designed to make tea,

265
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:32,279
but it's helpful to stir the tea and water, and produce froth.

266
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,650
So I use it for the moment.

267
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,229
What's it designed for?

268
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,630
- Collect evidence.
- Collect evidence?

269
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,919
When investigating lawsuits,

270
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:46,399
I had to analyze dirty water to get clues sometimes.

271
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,799
- Your Highness.
- If I allow it to be precipitated by itself,

272
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,630
it will cost a long time.

273
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,039
I may lose the opportunity to catch the suspects.

274
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,459
I found that if I rotate and vibrate the dirty water

275
00:20:58,459 --> 00:21:02,060
before the precipitation, I will need a much shorter time.

276
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,489
- Therefore—
- Enough! Stop it!

277
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:07,600
I lost my appetite now.

278
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,240
Ridiculous.

279
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,579
Jinbao, throw it away.

280
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:13,720
His Majesty lost his appetite.

281
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,430
Wait!

282
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,470
Leng Yue?

283
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,060
My greetings, Your Majesty.

284
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,300
It's been a long time.

285
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,039
You've grown up.

286
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,679
Princess Xiping told me you'd come here today,

287
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,579
I've arranged a seat for you.

288
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:37,280
Stand up.

289
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,520
Thank you.

290
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,520
Your Majesty, I heard you lost your appetite just now,

291
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,960
I want to give it back for you.

292
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,180
You can make tea, too?

293
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,860
A piece of cake.

294
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,349
And I don't need these things.

295
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,539
I just want a piece of tea block, a kettle of boiling water,

296
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:58,120
a big bowl, and a sword.

297
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:03,300
If you're happy with it, can I ask for something?

298
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,400
Okay.

299
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,180
Thank you.

300
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,290
General Wu.

301
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,159
General Wu, don't worry.

302
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,940
This person didn't die of plague.

303
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,530
Didn't he die of plague?

304
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,999
- Your Highness.
- What's the result?

305
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:39,760
Miss Chu has ascertained the death cause of the corpse.

306
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,309
I forgive you.

307
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:51,180
Since you believe I'm a good coroner, I won't leave.

308
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,399
The dead, male, about 30 years old.
[Transposition of viscera]

309
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,220
Died two days ago.

310
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,230
Whole body burned.

311
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,110
Spine curled up.

312
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,519
Split tibia in the left leg.
[Split tibia]

313
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:11,609
The third rib on the right side is broken,
[Viscera injured]

314
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:13,899
stabs in the lungs.
[Died of losing blood]

315
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:19,130
Mouth, nose and auditory meatus have residual blood.

316
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,609
rib was broken by an external force
[Nose, soot and charcoal ash, blood]

317
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:24,070
and stabbed in the lungs.

318
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,400
He died of blood lost, not plague.

319
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,470
She's really a good coroner.

320
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,999
Your Highness, on my way here,

321
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,999
I saw Imperial Medical Service and Imperial Insignia Guard

322
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,600
encircle the camp of Shen Army with a lot of people.

323
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,280
Should I send Miss Chu's investigation results to Imperial Medical Service?

324
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,880
Don't bother.

325
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,240
It's not bad for them to clear Shen Army.

326
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,970
And I need them to do this to help me lock them up for some days.

327
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,440
By the way, Your Highness, there's another thing.

328
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,540
Miss Chu asked about the pass.

329
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,360
What should I say?

330
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,560
Give it to her.

331
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,790
Give it to her?

332
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,879
Tell her it was found at the inn where she was staying before.

333
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,020
Your Highness, what if she leaves Three Judicial Chief Ministries?

334
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,640
[…I won't leave.]

335
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,230
She won't.

336
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,179
Good! Excellent!

337
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:41,160
You deserve your identity from a General Family.

338
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,960
Thank you.

339
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,589
What about my reward?

340
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,229
Reward! Tell me.

341
00:25:46,229 --> 00:25:48,050
What do you want?

342
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:55,689
Your Majesty, I want Sun Mingde to lead a horse

343
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:58,010
and show me around Daming Palace.

344
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,740
Okay. I agree.

345
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,030
Thank you.

346
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,910
Sir. I don't feel well.

347
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:18,140
I have a rest here. I'll go back now.

348
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,750
Thank you for your help in the matters

349
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,920
involving Feng Manor last night.

350
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,830
Thank you very much.

351
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,479
- This…
- Here are only you and me. Tell me the truth.

352
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:38,829
Did you complete the autopsy last night when you went to Feng Manor?

353
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,800
To be honest, sir, I did take a coroner there.

354
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,460
These are the tools left behind by the coroner.

355
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,670
You… You have the right to investigate all cases.

356
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,489
But Feng Jie's case, His Majesty had an order before.

357
00:26:53,489 --> 00:26:55,260
How dare you do this!

358
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,300
Thank you, sir.

359
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,980
I know I'm wrong.

360
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,069
I have another thing to tell you.

361
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:06,980
I'll leave the capital soon for Qianzhou in the southwest.

362
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,890
Qianzhou? What will you do?

363
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:12,089
Is it General Xiao…

364
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,840
My eldest brother is fine.

365
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,110
I want to find my father's whereabouts.

366
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,479
Did His Majesty agree?

367
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:19,480
His Majesty will.

368
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,120
You want to find your father in southwest?

369
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,380
Yes.

370
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,799
It's been years.

371
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,500
My mother never mentioned it to me.

372
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,380
I didn't know that what was buried

373
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,999
in my father's tomb was just a set of

374
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,699
clothes, until the day before yesterday.

375
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:49,919
The rebels tried to kill my father in the southwest at that time.

376
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,039
His whereabouts are a mystery.

377
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,540
It's affirmed my father was dead only after Qin Luan and his people

378
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,160
took back my father's things.

379
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,039
I believe it's still suspicious.

380
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,189
Why?

381
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,570
When I was investigating a murder case in the capital last night,

382
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:08,159
I found out that someone has been searching for news about my father.

383
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,260
It seems they've always been looking for my father for years.

384
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,310
Some people are looking for Xiao Heng?

385
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,629
- Who are they?
- I haven't figured it out.

386
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:19,249
Anyway, they are secretive.

387
00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:21,350
I don't think they are of goodwill.

388
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:24,799
I want to find out my father before they do

389
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,829
and figure out the details.

390
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,659
Managing criminal cases it's my business,

391
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:33,540
as well as my duty as a son.

392
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:38,570
You have to go to a far place to look for a missing person.

393
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,089
Any degree of certainty?

394
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:42,329
Even if there're only very few clues about my father,

395
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:44,660
I'd like to put all my effort into trying.

396
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,949
It's hard for you to be so loyal and filial.

397
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,399
In this case, I'd help you.

398
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,560
You are allowed to check it in the southwest.

399
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,640
Thank you, Your Majesty.

400
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,570
I have another thing to report.

401
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,680
Eunuch Sun, thank you for helping me to stay.

402
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
Hey.

403
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,760
You are welcome.

404
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,380
Sun Mingde.

405
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,730
Yes.

406
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,059
Your Majesty!

407
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:23,609
Go get the brocade cloak offered by Shengzhou

408
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:25,950
and give it to Commandery Prince An.

409
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,110
Yes, Your Majesty.

410
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,790
It's cold in the morning and evening in the mountainous southwest.

411
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,609
Pay more attention to your health.

412
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:40,470
Thank you, Your Majesty.

413
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,220
You may raise.

414
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,559
What else? Just go on.

415
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,840
Your Majesty, I've made it clear that Feng Jie, Minister of War,

416
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,200
Liu Yue, Director of the Ministry of Revenue, whose accidental death was reported last month,

417
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,729
Representative Lu Chuansheng of Capital Liaison Office in Qianzhou,

418
00:30:00,729 --> 00:30:03,189
were all killed by killers supported by Rugui Tavern.

419
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,690
What?

420
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,570
The cases are very complicated.

421
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,810
I've reported this all in the memorial.
[Memorial]

422
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,820
Please take a look.

423
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,249
Why did the killers kill the three?

424
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:21,419
- Not just three of them.
- Who else?

425
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:25,570
At the end of last year, I found officials died of an accident

426
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,799
during the year were nearly 30%

427
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,709
more than that of the years before.

428
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,349
I didn't think it was normal.

429
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,879
Last night, I checked the files again

430
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,849
when I found out the cause of Feng Jie's death, I figured out

431
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:41,899
those killers created many of the accidental death cases.

432
00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:44,850
Who appointed them?

433
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:48,160
Why did they kill the courtiers?

434
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,310
Not only courtiers.

435
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,109
I checked all accidental death cases

436
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,860
in the capital for recent ten years.

437
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,690
I found not only officials,

438
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,450
but also the servants and singers

439
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,210
have been killed by them.

440
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,780
These people don't have any relation.

441
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,959
That's not all.

442
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:11,380
Rugui Tavern also has an underground backroom.

443
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,210
A lot of surveillance records are there.

444
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:17,399
Almost the whole Chang'an has been involved in it.

445
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:18,359
What does that mean?

446
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:22,450
Rugui Tavern is doing business, an inn in front

447
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,059
but killing behind.

448
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:28,030
Also information dealing.

449
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,420
Xu Rugui is just a businessman.

450
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,440
He has no roots in Chang'an.

451
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,230
But he can do such business in the capital for over ten years

452
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,759
without being found.

453
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,680
There must be someone backing him.

454
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,579
What I'm more worried about is the payer for killing

455
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:48,920
Liu Yue, Lu Chuansheng and Feng Jie.

456
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,870
Go on!

457
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,920
Please take a look, Your Majesty.

458
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,910
It's produced in Qianzhou. What's wrong?

459
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,500
Your Majesty, this is official.

460
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,309
This is counterfeit.

461
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,210
Counterfeit?

462
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,899
The day before yesterday, I got several counterfeit cooper coins

463
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:14,919
from a Qianzhou business team by accident in the West Market.

464
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,759
So I asked people to pay attention.
[Kaiyuan Coin]

465
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,589
We found nearly 20% of the currency circulated
[2-Zhu in weight, red, mixed with copper and tin]

466
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:22,650
in the market is counterfeit.
[2.4-Zhu in weight, in copper]

467
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,419
When I did the exam for coroners,
[Fake Real]

468
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:26,059
I met a coroner from Qianzhou.

469
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:29,590
80% of her money was counterfeit.

470
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,260
You are right.

471
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,009
It's well duplicated.

472
00:32:34,009 --> 00:32:36,579
But the fineness is a bit different.

473
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,710
The counterfeit can be mixed in.

474
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,140
How can that be?

475
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:44,110
There must be someone who is making counterfeit copper coins.

476
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:47,109
Liu Yue was the Director of the Ministry of Revenue.

477
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:50,200
One of his duties is making coins.

478
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,680
Yes.

479
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,900
I guess this is the reason for Liu Yue's death.

480
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,360
Lu Chuansheng, Capital Liaison Representative of Qianzhou,

481
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,869
was responsible for the liaison of affairs between Qianzhou and Capital.

482
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:07,939
If there is illicit coin casting in Qianzhou,

483
00:33:07,939 --> 00:33:09,679
he should be the one to report it.

484
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,849
As well as Feng Jie.

485
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:12,659
He went to the southwest to inspect military affairs

486
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,909
and was assassinated on the night he returned to the Capital.

487
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,089
I have read his inspection minutes,

488
00:33:17,089 --> 00:33:18,909
but I didn't find anything abnormal.

489
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:22,249
But whether he really didn't find anything abnormal,

490
00:33:22,249 --> 00:33:25,349
we'll never know.

491
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:29,250
Your Majesty, army, money, and news…

492
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,560
All these three anomalies are from the Southwest.

493
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:37,030
I speculate that the buyer's intentions are malicious

494
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:40,210
and may endanger the stability of the Southwest.

495
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,609
How dare them!

496
00:33:43,609 --> 00:33:46,879
Your Majesty, when I searched Rugui Tavern last night,

497
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,220
Xu Rugui had escaped

498
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,420
and destroyed a large number of surveillance records.

499
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,919
In the remaining records, the one about my father was left.

500
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,469
It seems that someone wants me to investigate this matter.

501
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,830
Since all the clues point to the Southwest,

502
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:05,920
I plan to play along to find my father's whereabouts

503
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,179
and secretly investigate the anomalies of the Southwest

504
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,640
to draw the buyer and seller out.

505
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,060
In order not to alert the enemy,

506
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:16,189
Your Majesty, please withhold the information of this case from the public.

507
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,979
After I find out the truth and capture the buyer and seller,

508
00:34:19,979 --> 00:34:21,500
you can close the case.

509
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,060
Okay.

510
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,110
I grant you the prerogative to investigate this case.

511
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,319
to investigate this case.

512
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,780
Thank you, Your Majesty.

513
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,019
Oh, right.

514
00:34:30,019 --> 00:34:33,699
About Yan Ming's case, after the murderer committed suicide, there is no follow-up.

515
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:37,080
Is it also related to the Southwest?

516
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,429
I'm still investigating it.

517
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,960
I'll entrust you with the safety

518
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,659
of the people in the Southwest.

519
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:46,849
This trip is very dangerous.

520
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:49,799
Do you need me to send more guards to protect you?

521
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,319
Your Majesty, my trip to the Southwest this time

522
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,880
is in the name of finding my father's whereabouts.

523
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,499
If there are many people accompanying me,

524
00:34:56,499 --> 00:34:59,709
I am afraid that I will cause suspicion and get into trouble instead.

525
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:03,320
Your Majesty, please allow one person to go to the Southwest with me.

526
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,940
- Who is that?
- Vice Minister of the Court of Judicial Review, Jing Yi.

527
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,640
Let me ask you.

528
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,140
Why did Commandery Prince An

529
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,980
want to look for his father?

530
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,920
It's because of that coroner.

531
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,559
I've investigated her.

532
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,019
She is not involved in any parties in Chang'an.

533
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:26,699
In the future, you should be more careful with her.

534
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:29,009
You must also go to the Southwest with Commandery Prince An.

535
00:35:29,009 --> 00:35:30,389
Why should I go there?

536
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,949
I have things to do in Chang'an.

537
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,229
To do what?

538
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,090
Are you still thinking about Leng Yue?

539
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,760
Let me tell you.

540
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,949
If Commandery Prince An asks His Majesty for you,

541
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:46,470
then you have to go.

542
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,789
Father, do you think this girl has something to do with Prince Consort?

543
00:35:53,789 --> 00:35:55,760
Why do you say so?

544
00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:01,229
In addition to the jade pendant of Prince Consort and Princess Xiping,

545
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,330
she also has several volumes of legends.

546
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,429
According to His Highness, the cases in the legends

547
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,019
are adapted from the previous cases handled by the Prince Consort.

548
00:36:09,019 --> 00:36:10,459
Apart from His Highness and Prince Consort,

549
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:13,130
you're the one who's most familiar with these.

550
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,419
Legends?

551
00:36:14,419 --> 00:36:17,530
Yes. There is a Handsome Judge in it.

552
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,470
Handsome Judge?

553
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,499
Brother Jing, please speak your mind.

554
00:36:23,499 --> 00:36:27,820
Prince Consort, you've handled several big cases in a month.

555
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:32,060
I heard someone call you Judge behind your back.

556
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:36,960
They calling me Judge means that I'm just doing the right job.

557
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,129
Only when someone calls me Impartial Judge

558
00:36:39,129 --> 00:36:42,189
it mean I'm doing a great job.

559
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:45,360
Impartial Judge? No way.

560
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,580
Why is that?

561
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,359
Take a look at yourself.

562
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,880
You're not an Impartial Judge,

563
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,770
but a Handsome Judge.

564
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:59,000
Otherwise, Princess Xiping may not be happy.

565
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,410
Brother Jing, you're making fun of me.

566
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,210
So you gave him that nick name.

567
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:07,659
I was just joking.

568
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:10,369
When I said this, there was no one else but the two of us.

569
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:12,620
If anyone knew about this,

570
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,430
it would be Prince Consort himself.

571
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,300
Could it be…

572
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:25,240
Could it be that Prince Consort is in Qianzhou

573
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,260
and still alive?

574
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:45,030
