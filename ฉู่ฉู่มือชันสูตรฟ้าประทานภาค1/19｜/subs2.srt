00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,639
Xu Rugui used Chu Chu's identity

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,799
and induced Chu He to help him escape.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,080
I don't know if he is alive now.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,119
I am a survivor of the rebellious party.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,489
But Commandery Prince An jumped into the river to save me without hesitation.

7
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:30,640
I didn't realize how special Chu Chu was to me.

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,650
But Chu He is also...

9
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,529
You must go home when I ask you to.

10
00:00:37,529 --> 00:00:39,739
If you really see yourself as the coroner of Three Judicial Offices,

11
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,489
you must follow my orders.

12
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:43,559
If you think of my words as unworthy of your attention,

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,309
you shouldn't keep working for me.

14
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,891
Three Judicial Offices will be fine with one less coroner.

15
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,650
Come on, Miss Chu.

16
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,110
Let's go, come on.

17
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,300
Three Judicial Offices will be fine with one less coroner?

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,140
You too. Out.

[Episode 19]

21
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,959
Take it.

22
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,660
Come again.

23
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,719
I won't charge you if it's not tasty.

24
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,040
General Xiao, what's wrong with His Highness?

25
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,829
He...

26
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:18,889
Is he angry with me because I jumped into the water to save my brother?

27
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:20,439
- I'm good at swimming.
- Take a look.

28
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,829
He saw it.

29
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,899
Do you only see Chu He as your brother?

30
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,610
Of course.

31
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,629
What about Commandery Prince An?

32
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,430
What do you think of him?

33
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,439
- I think of him as a prince.
- Umbrella!

34
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,359
General Xiao, what do you want to say?

35
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,759
Umbrella!

36
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,959
Forget it. It's too complicated to be explained in a few words.

37
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,660
Miss Chu!

38
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,569
Deputy Magistrate Tan.

39
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,759
Is my brother awake?

40
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,349
General Xiao.

41
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,699
Miss Chu, don't worry.

42
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:52,760
It's not about Chu He.

43
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,539
Miss Chu, I don't know if it is convenient for you to have a few words with me.

44
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,190
Deputy Magistrate Tan, what's the matter?

45
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,649
Delicious rice noodles!

46
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,599
Since that thing happened in the Xu Mansion,

47
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,519
I have always wanted to talk to you but have never gotten the chance.

48
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,699
Deputy Magistrate Tan, you can just tell me.

49
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,199
When Xu Zongfang took you to the Xu Mansion,

50
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,989
there were only my father, Xu Zongfang and you in that room.

51
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,149
Now my father is gone

52
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,239
and Xu Zongfang is missing,

53
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,860
I can only ask you about what happened on that day.

54
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,329
- Well...
- Miss Chu, my father died a tragic death.

55
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,359
As his son, I don't even know the cause.

56
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,149
I've been anxious during these days

57
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,079
and I don't know how to face my mother.

58
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,379
Please let me know what happened.

59
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,500
Deputy Magistrate Tan, get up.

60
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,649
Xu Zongfang said that day that he wanted to avenge my mother.

61
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,690
If you want to avenge your mother, I can do it for you.

62
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,090
Then he killed Butler Tan.

63
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,919
My mother died an unfair death.

64
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,370
But I never wanted to avenge her in such a way.

65
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,490
Miss Chu, don't worry.

66
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,549
I don't blame you at all.

67
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,079
Thank you for telling me the truth.

68
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,039
I hope you can do me another favor.

69
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,140
Please don't tell Commandery Prince An about our conversation today.

70
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,909
Why?

71
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,879
I'm the Deputy Magistrate and the son of the deceased.

72
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,599
It's nothing wrong with asking that.

73
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,109
But for the sake of my career,

74
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,550
I think I should avoid arousing suspicion.

75
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,840
Okay.

76
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,660
Thank you, Miss Chu.

77
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,440
Vice Minister Jing.

78
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,809
- Are you going home?
- Yes.

79
00:06:37,809 --> 00:06:41,019
From the County Office to the Xu Mansion, you shouldn't go this way.

80
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,169
Vice Minister Jing, do you have any instructions?

81
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,710
I asked you to send out the message.

82
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,190
Why haven't I gotten any news from you?

83
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,960
Vice Minister Jing, I'll let you know immediately if I have any news.

84
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,149
Deputy Magistrate Tan, you should know

85
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,499
that I can tell if you are lying.

86
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,480
I... I dare not.

87
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,799
You got some news, but it's not for me.

88
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,830
It's for you, right?

89
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,079
Have you verified Chu Chu's identity?

90
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,139
Senior Jing doesn't want to get you involved.

91
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,869
Please don't waste his good intention.

92
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,140
What kind of things that I can't get involved in?

93
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,939
Are you going to...

94
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,440
Vice Minister Jing,

95
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,389
I've handled such matters many times.

96
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,840
Please don't worry about it.

97
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,329
My family is preparing for the funeral and there are a lot of things to do.

98
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:33,420
I should leave.

99
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,239
Your Grace.

100
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,449
Today, I got a very interesting endgame by chance.

101
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:50,709
I thought that you were a master of chess, so I'm here to consult you.

102
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,700
Have you ever seen such an endgame?

103
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,199
No, I haven't.

104
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,870
Please, Senior Jing.

105
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,890
Please, Your Grace.

106
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,030
Senior Jing, I remember when you and your wife got married,

107
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:20,560
my mother gave you a pair of lily hairpins as a wedding gift.

108
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,220
I wonder if that pair of hairpins is still in your mansion.

109
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,089
Your Grace, that's a hard question for me.

110
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,199
You know my wife well.

111
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,899
She buys a handful of hairpins all the time.

112
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,759
There are more hairpins in my mansion than the chopsticks in the kitchen.

113
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,489
They all look the same.

114
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,090
How can I recognize it?

115
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,500
Why do you suddenly ask about that?

116
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,879
A few days ago when I was at the flower market,

117
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,149
I saw someone wearing a similar one.

118
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,709
It just occurred to me.

119
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,189
I guess maybe Madam Jing gave it to someone else.

120
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,240
I'm just curious.

121
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,959
I'll ask her when I get back, then I'll let you know.

122
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,559
I know you are quite worried about the marriage of General Xiao

123
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,229
and Leng Peishan's daughter.

124
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,949
I want to give you a piece of advice.

125
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,990
I hope you can make this marriage happen as soon as possible.

126
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,580
A good marriage is fated. Why should we rush it?

127
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,299
A good relationship is fated. But human effort is the decisive factor.

128
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,480
This matter should be decided sooner than later.

129
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,509
Thank you for your concern.

130
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,379
I'll find a master and see if their dates of birth and eight characters match.

131
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,500
Then I'll discuss this with the emperor.

132
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,969
Your Grace, you are superb in chess.

133
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:57,120
I'm truly impressed.

134
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,360
You are flattering me.

135
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,269
Stop looking.

136
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,830
You are in Guanling Yamen now.

137
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,249
Why am I in Guanling Yamen?

138
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,750
Chu Chu?

139
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,599
Where's Chu Chu?

140
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,300
I want to see Chu Chu.

141
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,660
I want to see my sister!

142
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,510
Where is my sister?

143
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,440
Do you still see her as your sister?

144
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,760
Of course, she is my sister. Could it be...

145
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,339
Didn't Chu Chu tell you that her biological father, Yun Yi,

146
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,309
killed Xiao Jinyu and Xiao Jinli's father?

147
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,350
They must want to take revenge on her.

148
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,330
You killed my sister?

149
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,509
Listen!  If you dare do anything to my sister,

150
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,829
I will fight you with my life!

151
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,730
Fight me with your life?

152
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,730
Fight me with this?

153
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,069
You... You keep saying that Chu Chu is your sister.

154
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,829
That's how you put your sister in danger?

155
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:27,610
Listen! Chu Chu is at home now, telling your family that you are safe.

156
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,999
She is fine.

157
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,820
But she almost got killed in the river because of you.

158
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,569
Commandery Prince An, I did this all by myself.

159
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,109
It has nothing to do with Chu Chu.

160
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,479
It has nothing to do with my family.

161
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,280
What did you do?

162
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,450
I...

163
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,880
I heard the man who kidnapped Chu Chu,

164
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,760
was Chu Chu's uncle, Xu Zongfang.

165
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:04,919
I wanted to ask him if he was Chu Chu's family

166
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,600
and who else there was in Chu Chu's family.

167
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,980
But...

168
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,840
he told me

169
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:22,210
Chu Chu's father is the rebel who killed your father.

170
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:26,479
You two took Chu Chu out to kill her.

171
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,879
You just took that bandit's words?

172
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,780
I didn't.

173
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,770
But I worried...

174
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,679
I worried that you would imprison Chu Chu and interrogate her

175
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,910
if you knew about it.

176
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,549
It happened many years ago.

177
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,280
What can you find out?

178
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,189
His words were clear and logical.

179
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,269
If you take his words

180
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,719
and believe that Chu Chu is the child of your enemy,

181
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,430
she will be wronged.

182
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,720
That's why you gave him this filing blade and help him escape?

183
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,480
Chu Chu is my sister.

184
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,750
She is innocent.

185
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,329
I have to save her.

186
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,670
You were putting her in danger!

187
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,359
Chu He, even you don't trust my conduct,

188
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,919
you should have considered the possibility that the bandit was lying

189
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,389
and inducing you to untie him.

190
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,999
What you did was put Chu Chu in the position of being disloyal!

191
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,849
If what the bandit said were true and you helped him take away Chu Chu,

192
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,479
then Chu Chu would be doubly guilty.

193
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,479
Everyone in the Chu family would be punished.

194
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,349
If that bandit managed to escape, killed everyone in the Chu family

195
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,039
and killed innocent people, can you afford such a result?

196
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,240
Can Chu Chu afford it?

197
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,019
- I...
- As a coroner working in the County Office,

198
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:46,069
you are also a public servant.

199
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,309
But you acted recklessly.

200
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,000
You don't deserve to be called a faithful and upright subject as Chu Chu said.

201
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,509
You kept saying that what you did was for Chu Chu.

202
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:59,150
Do you have the nerve to say it again in front of Chu Chu?

203
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,350
Commandery Prince An.

204
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,039
I was too worried to think clearly.

205
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,039
You can punish me as you want.

206
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,820
Please don't punish Chu Chu and my family.

207
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,600
I'm glad you know your mistake.

208
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:29,949
As a matter of fact, Chu Chu knows what that bandit said

209
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,939
and she told me everything.

210
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,310
What did Chu Chu tell you?

211
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,189
Chu Chu and I are both public servants.

212
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,369
Chu Chu trusts me and I trust her.

213
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:47,049
I will handle it impartially and clarify the truth.

214
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,179
I won't wrong Chu Chu.

215
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,879
You can rest assured.

216
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,040
You must also remember not to do such stupid things again.

217
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,689
Otherwise, you won't be the only one to be punished.

218
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,179
I won't.

219
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,440
I won't do it again.

220
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,660
Let me ask you. How did you fall into the river?

221
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,519
After I gave the filing blade to Xu Rugui,

222
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,149
I kept an eye on the coffin shop.

223
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:18,669
I found Xu Rugui escaped after killing people.

224
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,570
There were also two bandits chasing him.

225
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,379
Did you fight with them?

226
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,999
No, no.

227
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,919
I followed them from a distance.

228
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,029
They were particularly cautious and I was almost spotted.

229
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:37,290
Then I slipped and fell into the river.

230
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,009
Did you see where they were heading for?

231
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,559
The northeast.

232
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,560
It seemed to be the direction of Phoenix Mountain.

233
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,189
Get up first.

234
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,270
Thank you, Commandery Prince An.

235
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,199
What you did is ridiculous, but you sincerely regretted

236
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,989
and almost got killed in the river,

237
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,459
I think you have learned your lesson.

238
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,019
I won't give you any serious punishment.

239
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:09,479
Let me ask you one thing.

240
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,269
You must answer me truthfully.

241
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,509
Please go ahead, I'll be honest.

242
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,079
I heard from Magistrate Zheng earlier

243
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,419
that the bridge between Guanling County and the outside was built five years ago.

244
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:24,119
Before that, it was very difficult to get in or leave Guanling County.

245
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,479
Is it true?

246
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,879
Yes, it's true.

247
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,370
The Prefect granted the money to build the bridge.

248
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,610
It was a great thing that benefited everyone in the county.

249
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,949
Do you still remember whether the bridge was finished

250
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:42,250
when Witch Doctor living in the back of your house left?

251
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,439
Not yet.

252
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,999
I remember it clearly.

253
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,969
My family also found it strange.

254
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,509
Witch Doctor's legs didn't work well.

255
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,719
He couldn't leave Guanling County at all.

256
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,360
How did he disappear suddenly?

257
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:00,549
Your Grace, you must be tired after playing chess with Senior Jing for so long.

258
00:17:00,549 --> 00:17:02,569
I've asked someone to prepare some hot water

259
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,699
and give you a bath later to relieve your fatigue.

260
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,230
I'm afraid...

261
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,200
that Jing Zhi came here not just to play chess with me.

262
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,209
I can't help but feel worried.

263
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:20,159
I think Senior Jing came to urge you to promote Miss Leng's marriage.

264
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,070
The more he urges me,

265
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:26,450
the more it means this marriage won't work.

266
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,009
I hope Mr. Xue can talk the emperor out of this idea

267
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,399
during their trip to Qianzhou.

268
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,029
Your Grace, are you worried that it will involve General Leng's military power

269
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:38,620
if General Xiao and Miss Leng get married?

270
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,029
Not all because of this.

271
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,430
If we only consider the interests involved in this marriage,

272
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,309
it's safer to let Leng Yue marry Jinyu.

273
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,600
It won't involve the military power of the Leng clan

274
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,049
and can make the Leng clan continue to support Jinyu in the court.

275
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,309
What I care about is still Yue.

276
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,529
She has been following Jinyu since she was a child.

277
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,279
She does everything Jinyu tells her to do.

278
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,479
I guess she had fallen for Jinyu a long time ago.

279
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,559
It's just Jinyu cares about nothing else but official affairs.

280
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,609
I always wanted to find a chance and talk to Jinyu about it.

281
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:13,759
Tell him not to fail Yue.

282
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,199
Unexpectedly, such a thing happened before I got the chance.

283
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,300
Now Yue is going to be Jinyu's sister-in-law.

284
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,359
Your Grace, be at ease.

285
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,169
We have Mr. Xue's full support in this matter.

286
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,069
Besides, Commandery Prince An is also in Qianzhou.

287
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,029
He has been thoughtful since he was young.

288
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:37,909
If he knows it, he will figure out a way to solve all the problems.

289
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,879
Have you asked Wu Jiang?

290
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,549
Is there any news about Jinyu recently?

291
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,429
Yes.

292
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,599
Wu Jiang said that His Highness is at Miss Chu's house in Guanling.

293
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,739
Who?

294
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:48,910
The female coroner.

295
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,610
Coroner?

296
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,709
Have you met that coroner?

297
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,239
What does she look like?

298
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,030
She...

299
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,930
She is delicate.

300
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,769
What if we compare her with Leng Yue?

301
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,279
How can they be compared?

302
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,719
Miss Leng is one of the most beautiful girls in Chang'an.

303
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,789
That girl is cuter than Miss Leng.

304
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,849
But in terms of appearance, she is just delicate.

305
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:21,000
There is no way to compare her with Leng Yue.

306
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,110
Cute?

307
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:31,650
I mean, could it be that Jinyu just likes cute girls?

308
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,750
Chu Chu!

309
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,749
His Highness always protects me.

310
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,010
He said I'm the best coroner.

311
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,649
But why did he say that to me?

312
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,249
You must go home when I ask you to.

313
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,679
If you really see yourself as the coroner of Three Judicial Offices,

314
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,559
you must follow my orders.

315
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,739
If you think of my words as unworthy of your attention,

316
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,749
you shouldn't keep working for me.

317
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,531
Three Judicial Offices will be fine with one less coroner.

318
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,070
Chu Chu.

319
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,229
Father.

320
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,139
What are you thinking about?

321
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,279
Nothing.

322
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,200
I'm just thinking where

323
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,040
that man could escape to.

324
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,779
Chu Chu,you know who that person is. Right?

325
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,819
Yes.

326
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,540
That man is my uncle.

327
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:03,220
You also know it, right?

328
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:09,469
Your brother accidentally heard a few words said by the people around that lord.

329
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:12,699
When I sent water to them last night, I took a look at that person.

330
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,659
Although his eyes were covered and his mouth gagged,

331
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,909
I could still recognize him.

332
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,070
That's Master Xu.

333
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,369
I didn't dare to tell your brother because I was afraid that he couldn't hold back his temper and make a big deal out of

334
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:24,620
I only told your grandpa.

335
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,999
Chu Chu, don't think too much about it.

336
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,309
Xu Zongfang is Xu Zongfang. You are you.

337
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,909
No matter what he did, it has nothing to do with you.

338
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:34,999
Do you know it?

339
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,279
Yes, I do.

340
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,399
Father, don't worry.

341
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,249
I won't bring shame on the Chu clan.

342
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,769
Of course, you won't.

343
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:44,089
You are Commandery Prince An's coroner now.

344
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:47,449
You make the Chu clan proud, right?

345
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,450
Don't think too much about it.

346
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,090
Your Highness, Miss Leng and Magistrate Zheng are here.

347
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,769
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

348
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,609
Magistrate Zheng, please wait inside for a while.

349
00:22:17,609 --> 00:22:19,210
Yes.

350
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,999
What's wrong?

351
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,300
How did you know something was wrong?

352
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,839
If there was nothing wrong,

353
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,309
you would have sent the medicine to the kitchen first.

354
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,810
You wouldn't have come here to stop me.

355
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,660
What is it?

356
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,879
There is a little thing I'm curious about.

357
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,999
I want to ask you casually.

358
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,210
Then I will listen casually.

359
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,789
Your Highness, does the Deputy Magistrate Tan Gui have any relation with you?

360
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,259
What relation?

361
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:55,120
Like is he your confidant or your spy?

362
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,779
Why do you ask that?

363
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,979
Answer my question first.

364
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,789
No.

365
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,829
Really?

366
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,519
No.

367
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,260
If he were my confidant,

368
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,890
how is it that I didn't know Xu Rugui was Xu Zongfang until now?

369
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,949
All right, you just casually asked me.

370
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,829
And I've casually heard you.

371
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,429
Just take the medicine to the kitchen

372
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,829
and ask someone to decoct it for Chu He.

373
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,409
Get him some food.

374
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:26,970
Let him go home after he gets better lest the Chu family should worry.

375
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,809
Your Highness, don't you want to ask me why I asked you that?

376
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,540
You will tell me when you figure it out.

377
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,440
You already know it?

378
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,030
Know what?

379
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,379
Know that Jing Yi has been stalking me

380
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:48,980
and sending messages to Chang'an behind my back?

381
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:54,599
Or know that you found out the person Jing Yi has been meeting behind my back is Tan Gui?

382
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,470
You know it.

383
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,429
It's nothing strange that I know it.

384
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:03,289
Jing Yi has been around me for almost 20 years.

385
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:06,889
It's too obvious for me about what he does and what he doesn't do.

386
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:12,100
He also knows if I know about what he does.

387
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,659
Your Highness, there must be some misunderstanding here.

388
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,599
You know that Jing Yi will never hurt you.

389
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,549
I know.

390
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,160
The strange thing is how do you know it?

391
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,740
Have you been stalking him?

392
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,079
I... When I was keeping an eye on Chu Chu,

393
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,050
I saw Jing Yi stalking you and Chu Chu.

394
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:34,139
I thought Jing Yi was after Chu Chu.

395
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,919
I was worried that the Jing family would do something to Chu Chu,

396
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,670
so I stalked him a few times.

397
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:44,959
Earlier, I found out by chance that he met someone alone.

398
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,799
I didn't see that person's face, but I saw the footprints.

399
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,239
When I saw Tan Gui's just now, I realized that he was

400
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,689
the person Jing Yi met.

401
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,749
Your Highness, what is Jing Yi doing?

402
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,550
Don't worry.

403
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,840
What Jing Yi needs to do in his life

404
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,030
is not only the work I give him.

405
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:11,159
It's just like I won't let him do all the work.

406
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,739
It's the same.

407
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,119
When it's necessary.

408
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,730
He will give me an explanation.

409
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,619
Your Highness, thank you.

410
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,059
For what?

411
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,560
Thank you for trusting Jing Yi.

412
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,650
Why should you thank me?

413
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,610
Your Highness, you...

414
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:35,110
Your Highness. Your Highness.

415
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,599
Forgive me for interrupting you.

416
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,089
Just say it.

417
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,850
Something weird happened.

418
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,239
I don't know what to do.

419
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,009
So I'm here to ask you for advice.

420
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:54,029
Chu He asked me for flogging.

421
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,009
Ask you for what?

422
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,879
Flogging… He wants to get beaten.

423
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,829
He asked me to beat him.

424
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,280
Why does he want to get beaten?

425
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,479
I don't know.

426
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,479
I asked him why, but he wouldn't tell me.

427
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,189
He said he deserves it.

428
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,480
Your Highness,

429
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,089
what should I do?

430
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,880
Just give him what he wants.

431
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,079
What kind of thing is that to give him flogging?

432
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,200
He asked for it.

433
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,029
Flog him as many times as he asks.

434
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,279
Don't beat him too hard.

435
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,309
Just let him suffer a little bit.

436
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,890
Remember not to hurt his bones.

437
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:39,999
- Yes.
- Also remember, don't let others know what I just said to you.

438
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,709
What are you waiting for?

439
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,089
You've never been here.

440
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,790
Do you understand?

441
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,319
Yes.

442
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,669
I think I understand. I understand.

443
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,370
I understand.

444
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,760
Your Highness, does the medicine for Chu He need to be decocted?

445
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,639
[Shangyang Gate]

446
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,149
Minister Han is perceptive indeed.

447
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:08,029
That female coroner only took an exam in the Three Judicial Offices,

448
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,999
and you found out her identity

449
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,999
as a survivor of the rebellious party through the details.

450
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,579
Yes. Minister Han is great indeed.

451
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:18,210
Be careful of your words.

452
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,429
She is suspected of being the daughter of a rebel.

453
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:27,589
We still need the emperor to make the final decision.

454
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,759
However, as public servants,

455
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,679
we should always remember the teachings of Commandery Prince An.

456
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,949
We can't make any mistake in this matter.

457
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:40,170
Otherwise, he has a lot of ways to teach us a lesson.

458
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,569
Yes.

459
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:45,839
Commandery Prince An hasn't realized he opened the door to a dangerous person.

460
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,739
If it wasn't for you to find out who she was,

461
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,329
I'm afraid he can't come back to Chang'an alive.

462
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:56,239
Commandery Prince An hired the daughter of a rebel.

463
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,459
After he returns to Chang'an,

464
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,960
he should punish himself for hiring the wrong person.

465
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,640
Yes.

466
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,669
It's just Xue Rucheng who took the credit.

467
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:10,319
If he wasn't ordered to handle affairs in Qianzhou,

468
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,989
how would the emperor ask him to investigate it and catch the rebels by the way?

469
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:16,739
He took the credit for nothing.

470
00:28:16,739 --> 00:28:20,110
All right, no big deal.

471
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,939
A person points at the rabbit.

472
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,209
A dog catches the rabbit.

473
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:27,189
The emperor knows who makes what contributions.

474
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,370
We don't need to take this credit.

475
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,999
Moreover, the daughter of a rebel threatens Commandery Prince An's life.

476
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,159
Xue Rucheng dares not neglect it.

477
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,040
It's a good thing for us.

478
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,799
We don't need to confront the Commandery Prince An

479
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,359
and he saved us from the hardship of the trip.

480
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,009
Why shouldn't we feel happy about it?

481
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,529
Brilliant.

482
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:49,330
Yes.

483
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,599
Hurry. Hurry up.

484
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,999
Set the meal.

485
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,930
Don't delay the meal.

486
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,809
Minister Han.

487
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:14,679
Eunuch Qin.

488
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:19,400
Congratulations, you've found out the survivor of the rebellious party.

489
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:24,100
This is what I should do.

490
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,300
Yes.

491
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,989
What is this?

492
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,189
How can we eat this?

493
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,269
Eunuch Qin, did you serve the wrong dishes?

494
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,619
Yes.

495
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,279
That's what you are going to eat today.

496
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,849
The emperor said it's not easy for Tang to be peaceful.

497
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:42,509
You are the pillars of the country.

498
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,069
You should be prepared for danger in times of peace.

499
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,529
Don't forget His Majesty's grace and your responsibility

500
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,459
when you get cocky.

501
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:53,680
Minister Han, am I right?

502
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,229
Yes.

503
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:59,309
All right, enjoy your meal.

504
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:04,010
Enjoy your meal. Enjoy your meal.

505
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,599
It isn't so much about Han Ji taking the credit.

506
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:22,120
It's about Han Ji finishing this tricky matter for us.

507
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,810
You are right, Master.

508
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:30,799
Ever since the female coroner came to Chang'an,

509
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,460
there hasn't been one day that is not troublesome.

510
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,829
After I get something useful out of her,

511
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,999
I'm going to vent out all of my anger.

512
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,830
I won't let her die easily.

513
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:50,200
Then you need to hurry up and think about how to kill her.

514
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:56,700
Listen... It won't take us long to get her.

515
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,080
That's great.

516
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,179
Xiao Jinli?

517
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:28,080
Leng Yue?

518
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,010
Why are you here?

519
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:34,299
I found him strange when he stopped Miss Chu on the street

520
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,469
and asked her some questions.

521
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,079
A moment ago, I saw him sneak out from the County Office.

522
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,439
I'm afraid he will do harm to you. So I've been following him.

523
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:42,879
Then I saw him lying in ambush near the Chu house.

524
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,209
He followed Miss Chu all the way here and tried to attack Miss Chu.

525
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,130
But I didn't expect her to be Leng Yue.

526
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:51,590
Say it!  What do you want to do?

527
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:54,439
I want to kill Chu Chu to avenge my father!

528
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,609
No wonder.

529
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:58,289
You asked Miss Chu how your father died.

530
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,619
She told me. Then I told Commandery Prince An.

531
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:02,119
Miss Chu is clever.

532
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,189
She said it's only when bad people want to do bad things

533
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:05,599
that they don't want Commandery Prince An to know it.

534
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,229
You are really up to no good.

535
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,489
Jinyu, we're on the same page this time.

536
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:12,990
You asked Leng Yue to dress as Chu Chu in order to catch him, right?

537
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,339
Despicable. Shameless.

538
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,459
What did you say? I'll chop your head off.

539
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:20,589
Xiao Jinli, it has nothing to do with you. You'd better leave.

540
00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:22,469
Why does it have nothing to do with me? I just saved you.

541
00:32:22,469 --> 00:32:23,619
Did I ask you to save me?

542
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,649
- I...
- All right.

543
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,359
We don't need to keep it from him.

544
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,260
Keep me from what?

545
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:38,160
Tan Gui, you should know why I got someone to dress as Chu Chu.

546
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,879
This method isn't above-board.

547
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,909
But this is the only way to get you out and make things clear for you.

548
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:51,230
I don't understand what you are saying.

549
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,639
You don't understand?

550
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,129
You went to see Chu Chu in front of Jinli on purpose,

551
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,349
and asked her mysteriously about your father's death.

552
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,829
You even told her not to tell me about it

553
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,289
to make sure I would know it.

554
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,639
You asked about your father's death.

555
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,969
In this way, whether you will make it or not,

556
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,879
it can be the most powerful testimony

557
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,189
to explain why you want to kill Chu Chu.

558
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,729
What do you mean?

559
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:17,029
- I don't understand.
- Enough!

560
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,799
Stop lying at this point.

561
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,980
What you did is really shameful.

562
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,609
My family asked him to kill Chu Chu.

563
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,530
Vice Minister Jing, you can't...!

564
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,169
- Brother, no!
- Xiao Jinli, are you crazy?

565
00:33:32,169 --> 00:33:35,129
I'm sick of your Jing family's sneaky tactics.

566
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,889
Say it!  What are you up to?

567
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,639
It has nothing to do with Vice Minister Jing.

568
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,799
Shut up!

569
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,499
Say it!  Why do you want to kill Miss Chu?

570
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:43,919
Say it! Why do you have to kill Chu Chu?

571
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,830
Commandery Prince An. General Xiao.

572
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:50,059
Chu Chu is the daughter of the person who killed your father.

573
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,839
What?

574
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,869
Vice Minister Jing, do you still remember the hairpin we rubbed?

575
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:56,669
The one Chu Chu's mother gave to her.

576
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,599
Your mother recognized the pattern on it.

577
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,279
She gave this hairpin to a general's wife as a wedding gift.

578
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,709
That general is Yun Yi, a subordinate of the Military Commissioner of Jiannan.

579
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,859
Chu Chu is Yun Yi's daughter,

580
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,609
which means she is a survivor of the rebellious party.

581
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:11,509
After I passed the Imperial Examination, I took Senior Jing as my master.

582
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,759
Then I went back to Qianzhou to look for and get rid of

583
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,549
these fugitives to avenge Prince Consort.

584
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,100
Why are you stopping me?

585
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,499
Vice Minister Jing, how should you explain to Senior Jing?

586
00:34:23,499 --> 00:34:24,829
I don't need to explain to him.

587
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,979
He wants to kill Chu Chu for someone who was like a real brother to him.

588
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,160
I won't let him kill Chu Chu

589
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,830
also for someone who is like a real brother to me.

590
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,789
These are two different things. But the feelings are the same.

591
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:39,329
My father knew I would do this.

592
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,509
That's why he kept it from me and asked you to do these things.

593
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:44,850
No need to say much. I trust you.

594
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:50,109
Commandery Prince An, what Senior Jing did is for avenging your father.

595
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,159
That's your father!

596
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,789
Why are you protecting your enemy's daughter?

597
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,270
You can only protect her for a while.

598
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:00,980
Even if I won't say it and they won't say it,

599
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,579
but someone else will reveal her identity one day.

600
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,339
At that time, you will be convicted of covering up the survivor of the rebellious party.

601
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,669
What's in that for you?

602
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:12,530
How should you face Prince Consort and Princess Xiping?

603
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,899
General Xiao, are you also going to let her get away with it?

604
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,599
Even if she is a survivor of the rebellious party,

605
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,939
it's the County Office's bushiness to punish her.

606
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,530
Senior Jing can't use lynching.

607
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,829
Deputy Magistrate Tan,

608
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,569
since you work for Senior Jing,

609
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,959
you should know why I came to the Southwest this time.

610
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,069
Senior Jing wants you to kill Chu Chu to avenge my father.

611
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,329
But if my father wants you to let her go,

612
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,479
are you willing to put off killing Chu Chu

613
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,919
and tell Senior Jing about the situation first?

614
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,380
You mean Prince Consort is still...?

615
00:35:51,970 --> 00:36:00,990
