Chu Chu went to the river and got the mirror back alone.

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,469
I knew she did it for me.

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,200
But nothing in this world could be more precious than her life.

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,050
I always put her in danger and make her sad.

6

How can I really be nice to her?

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,520
indicate the southwest of Phoenix Mountain.

9
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,779
Is there any shelter over there?

10
00:00:42,779 --> 00:00:44,009
There?

11
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:47,259
There isn't any shelter. That's the wetlands.

12
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:48,779
There's a big swamp,

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,329
with many vipers and scorpions. It's a very dangerous place.

14
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:53,139
Few people go there.

15
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,650
If he went there, I'm afraid he could hardly survive.

16
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,770
No, no, no, Your Highness. I didn't mean that.

17
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,559
Sir Witch Doctor must be alive!

18
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,849
He's so smart.

19
00:01:03,849 --> 00:01:05,629
He left such a complicated indication.

20
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,509
The danger in the swamp wasn't a big deal to him.

21
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,749
Maybe, he put something there and then moved to another place.

22
00:01:12,749 --> 00:01:16,299
I mean it's hard to get there.

23
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:19,299
If we want to get there, we must be well prepared.

24
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:21,710
Your Highness, I...

25
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,209
I understand.

26
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:27,010
I'm sorry.

[Episode 21]

29
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,699
Flowers flourish in the imperial garden.

30
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:18,020
But I remember you don't like flowers, but cattails.

31
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,459
Flowers are beautiful but bloom only in certain seasons.

32
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,879
After waiting for a long season, people can only enjoy them for a few days.

33
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,959
Soon, they wither and fall, leaving nothing but memories.

34
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,419
Cattail is better.

35
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,369
It looks plain, but it blooms all year round.

36
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,969
It makes people feel relieved.

37
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,470
It doesn't sound like you.

38
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,969
Xiao Heng said that, didn't he?

39
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,250
He doesn't like flowers.

40
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,239
He likes rocks only.

41
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,090
I heard that your love token was a pair of rocks.

42
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,159
Yes.

"Like a rock, you should withstand all the blast.

That, thin like silk thread, remains tough.

A-clinging to the boulder giant."

Did you get your love token because of this poem?

49
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,189
It's made of rock?

50
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,189
Yes, rock.

51
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,319
Where did you get it?

52
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,700
I picked it near the pond in my house.

53
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,359
You're frank.

54
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,839
Do you still remember I'm a princess?

55
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,929
I don't even want jewels or jade.

56
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,799
How dare you give me a rock from your pond.

57
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,249
I know you like cattails, though flowers are beautiful.

58
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:36,309
Then I know I can't touch you with jewels, but with a rock.

59

64
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,559
It's a good poem, but it doesn't mean good.

65
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,319
Do you compare us to the miserable couple in the poem?

66
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,550
I don't dare to. Please let me explain.

67
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,889
Look, Your Highness.

68
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,310
Cattail mostly grows near shoals,

69
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,349
where there're many rocks.

70
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,740
On sunny days, rocks and cattails stay with each other quietly.

71
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:16,170
On stormy days, rocks stabilize cattails to protect them from storms.

72
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,869
I don't want to be a jade pendant around your waist

73
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,439
as an ornament to your glory.

74
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,280
Instead, I want to be a rock, to always protect you.

75
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:39,139
I heard that you and your husband loved each other.

76
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,070
I didn't know you loved each other so much.

77
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,330
Don't tease me, Your Majesty.

78
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:52,349
It was Xiao Heng's duty to sacrifice everything for our nation.

79
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,149
My sons should do that, too.

80
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,310
It's tough for you, though.

81
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,709
Your Majesty, if you think I deserve some pity,

82
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,089
please show some mercy on Leng Yue.

83
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,199
Don't let her suffer the same as me.

84
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,010
Do you mean all the officials shouldn't get married or have descendants?

85
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:20,149
Xiping, I kindly make a match between Xiao Jinli and Leng Yue.

86
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:22,269
As a member of the imperial family,

87

you should understand what an honor it is!

88
00:06:24,989 --> 00:06:27,249
Don't be ungrateful!

- Say no more!

When's Xiao Jinli's birthday?

91
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,449
As his mother, you don't need to calculate it. Right?

92
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,689
Now that you fail to divine their birthdays for days,

93
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,350
let the imperial astronomer do it!

94
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

95
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,420
Jinbao,

96
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,929
did His Majesty only say that to Princess Xiping?

97
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,939
Yes. I don't dare to lie.

98
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,119
How easy it is to be an emperor in the flourishing age!

99
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:12,939
There's no domestic trouble or foreign invasion.

100
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,180
He even tries to be a matchmaker.

101
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,870
All right. Go take care of His Majesty.

102
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,370
Yes.

103
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,269
Master, His Majesty is quite odd lately.

104
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,299
Think about it.

105
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,349
Yesterday, he asked about the birthday of Xiao Jinli and Xiao Jinyu.

106
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,699
Today, he brought it up again to Princess Xiping.

107
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:45,369
He even pressed for detailed birthdates in public.

108
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,459
Did His Majesty also think of...?

109
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,089
What?

110
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,339
Master, don't you remember?

111
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,549
In old years when Princess Xiping gave birth to the boys,

112
00:07:55,549 --> 00:07:58,279
people gossiped a lot.

113
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:04,279
Even if His Majesty was biding his time or ignoring everything,

114
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,950
he must have heard about it.

115
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,669
Now that you brought it up, ask your men to check on it.

116
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:23,399
By the way, Zhou Han was sent to ask about Duke Chang.

117
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,180
Why hasn't he gotten anything yet?

118
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,070
He just hasn't.

119
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,079
Chang'an isn't so big.

120
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,070
He should have even searched the entire city.

121
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,640
Why hasn't he got anything yet?

122
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,849
Master, think about it.

123
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:46,639
Zhou Han... It's hard to comment on him.

124
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,799
You have no idea what he always does with your award.

125
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,139
The other day, I heard that he visited Pingkang Residence every day.

126
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:59,510
He's very likely to enjoy himself there, in your name.

127
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:06,699
If your senior had come back after searching for Xiao Heng in the Southwest,

128
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:12,220
I needn't have used losers like Zhou Han!

129
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,700
Master, no offense,

130
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,480
but do you really think my senior ran away depending on his great martial arts

131
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,249
and has been enjoying his life, regardless of anything else?

132
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,150
You finally used your brain.

133
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,849
It must be more complicated.

134
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:40,730
Someone must be opposing me very secretly!

135
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,899
Master, could it be Xiao Heng?

136
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,729
Think about it.

137
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,879
We last heard about him when our men came back from Qianzhou

138
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:54,879
and told us they found his trace.

139
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,409
Over so many years, we haven't gotten any news about him anymore.

140
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,099
But if it's him, that's also weird.

141
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,579
He rejected the bright future we offered and abandoned his family.

142
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,140
What's he after?

143
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,170
It's what always worries me.

144
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,890
This is ridiculous.

145
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,979
Not to mention years, I can't stay here for even one single day.

146
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,169
At night, poison gas spreads, snakes and worms run about.

147
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,099
How could Prince Consort live in such a place?

148
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,339
Your Highness, are you fooling me?

149
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,170
Don't talk nonsense.

150

Deputy Magistrate Tan, I'm warning you.

151
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:42,819
If you keep talking nonsense, I'll ask General Xiao to shut your mouth with smelly socks.

152
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,609
I'll say no more.

153
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,729
You really have smelly socks?

154
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,959
Put them away. How insulting!

I guess it's where Sir Witch Doctor indicated.

159
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,099
Now that Father indicated this place,

160
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,320
he wouldn't try to get us killed.

161
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,199
But it's quite a big place without signs to show the way.

162

You don't need to climb high. Come down!

170
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,289
Yeah. I'm better at exploring the way in such a place.

00:11:39,289 --> 00:11:41,000

Were they here before?

They don't look like nests of animals.

179
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:20,510
They look like...

180
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,580
Tombs?

181
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,420
Looks like someone piled the rocks deliberately.

182
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,359
Your Highness, these are rocks Sir Witch Doctor used to make chess pieces.

183
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,960
What's wrong, Your Highness?

184
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,920
Father...

185
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,610
He's in the swamp?

186
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,910
What? How could Father be in the swamp?

187
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,120
Light spots on the wall

188
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,879
lead to this place where there's a large swamp.

189
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,120
The chess game indicates

190
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,110
the exact location in the swamp.

191
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,560
Chess game?

192
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:14,999
Three piles of rocks represent three chess pieces.

193
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:16,319
[Rook | Knight]

194
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,299
[Elephant | Pawn]

195
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:20,560
The fourth chess piece...
[Pawn]

196
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,560
Prince Consort...

197
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,310
No way.

198
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,740
It's impossible!

199
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,709
He hid the corpse and left a chess game!

200
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,199
He took so much trouble to get us here!

201
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,400
He couldn't have...!

202
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,929
Your Highness, could Sir Witch Doctor have only left a clue in the swamp?

203
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:01,879
Just like the chess game.

204
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:05,769
It's a clue, leading us to another place.

205
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,760
Yes, you're right.

206
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,350
It must be a clue in the swamp.

207
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,420
- Vice General!
- Yes.

208
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,129
Take your men with me and find out the clue!

209
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,530
Yes.

210
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,639
You guys, come over!

211
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,140
Yes!

212
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,920
No.

213
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,609
There isn't another place.

214
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,129
Why?

215
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,909
I think Chu Chu makes sense.

216
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:33,079
If Prince Consort doesn't want to be easily found,

217
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:37,249
it's very possible that he left more clues, leading to many other places.

218
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,590
Like Tan Gui said,

219
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:44,540
poison gas spreads at night.

220
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,439
Snakes and worms run about.

221
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:53,140
It even took strong men like us half a day to walk here.

222
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,899
Father had difficulty moving about.

223
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:59,320
When he came all the way here, calibrated the location,

224
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,350
and piled the rocks, he couldn't leave before it got dark.

225
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,319
Couldn't he have come a few more times and did a bit of work every time

226
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,880
before it got dark?

227
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,410
He couldn't.

228
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,539
Now that he used such a complicated chess game

229
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:24,239
to hide the clues for this place, it means this place was crucial

230
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:26,119
and he didn't want others to notice.

231
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:29,899
If he came frequently, someone could have tracked him down.

232
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,250
Then his efforts on the chess game

233
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,769
would have been wasted.

234
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,319
- But...
- Leng Yue, let's check other places.

235
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,079
Why?

236
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,980
Come and you'll know.

237
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,929
Come on.

238
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:57,200
What exactly do you want?

239
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,879
His Highness is used to thinking of the worst.

240
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,039
But mostly, for the safety of his subordinates.

241
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,539
This time, he's looking for his father.

242
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:09,389
He wants a favorable turn more than anyone else.

243
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,129
Now that he came to the conclusion,

244
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:15,239
he must have weighed all possibilities in his heart.

245
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,699
As he was weighing the possibilities, his hope was gradually shattered,

246
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:20,749
just like being dismembered.

247
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,390
Do you know how miserable it was?

248
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,209
The more he explains, the more pain he has to experience.

249
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,680
If you trust him, ask no more.

250
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,000
All right.

251
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,470
I was impetuous just now.

252
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,040
What about Chu Chu?

253
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,469
She understands.

254
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,229
What she told His Highness that it was the clue in the swamp...

255
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,999
She didn't even believe that.

256
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,819
But she never lies to His Highness.

257
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:55,000
Everyone knows how to lie,

258
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,700
but they just don't want to or don't need to.

259
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:05,430
If Prince Consort really died, what will happen to Chu Chu?

260
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,800
Will your father let go of her?

261
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,209
Don't worry. When I'm around,

262
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:14,460
I won't let anyone from my family hurt Chu Chu.

263
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,780
Chu Chu…

264
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,080
Say no more, Your Highness.

265
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:22,799
I trust you. I know it.

266
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,820
I believe whatever you say.

267
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,450
Thank you.

268
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,660
Jinyu, is Father really in the swamp?

269
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,260
Yes.

270
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,410
He's waiting for the Handsome Judge.

271
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,670
After staying in the swamp alone

272
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,120
for five years, what does Father still have?

273
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:19,180
His skeleton, or even not a complete skeleton?

274
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,519
- Your Highness...
- Just tell me.

275
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,220
Could he…

276
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,229
not have even crushed bones?

277
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,309
No, I didn't mean that.

278
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:36,710
Your Highness, do you remember the corpse your father hid in the wall?

279
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,440
He would also have a corpse like that.

280
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,820
It's called wet corpse in our industry.

281
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,620
Wet corpse?

282
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,229
Fish, shrimp, and shellfish can hardly survive in a swamp.

283
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,189
Because the swamp is totally airtight,

284
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,819
corpses can be easily preserved.

285
00:19:57,819 --> 00:20:02,509
They'll be preserved in a better way than your father used to store the eunuch.

286
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:06,399
Wrapped in waterproof oilcloth, a man would be in the swamp...

287
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,970
As if in a natural coffin.

288
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,090
General, we found him!

289
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:24,810
Jinyu, if Father arranged this,

290
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,580
how did he wrap himself?

291
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,040
How...? How come?

292
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:47,810
General Xiao, may I borrow a dagger?

293
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,829
I'm a coroner.

294
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,709
After getting on with Sir Witch Doctor for so many years,

295
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,040
I know how to recognize him.

296
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,109
Let me do it.

297
00:21:56,109 --> 00:21:58,110
I can recognize him.

298
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,819
He... He's...?

299
00:22:45,819 --> 00:22:47,720
You know him?

300
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,259
- Does he have a scald on his left arm?
- You...?

301
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:56,260
He gave you the pendant, didn't he?

302
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:05,519
The Handsome Judge let out a sigh of relief and felt ardent.

303
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:12,010
No matter how long or how deep one thing is hidden,

304
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:16,040
it always waits to be rediscovered.

305
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,930
It's him.

306
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,450
Considering his appearance,

307
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:35,240
his height, the wound on his leg,

308
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,110
and the scar on his arm.

309
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,810
Your Highness,

310
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,799
I'm finished.

311
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,519
How did he die?

312
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,459
There're many blood dots
[Facial vessels]

313
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:36,309
in the fundus of his eyes, corners of his eyes, his face, and neck.

314
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,639
His neck has obvious blood stasis.
[Blood dots on the neck]

315
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,160
He was suffocated to death.
[Blood vessel engorgement]

316
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,980
Do you mean he was alive before he was thrown into the swamp

317
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,410
and he was drowned by someone?

318
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,810
He drowned himself.

319
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,420
Why? Why did he do that?

320
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,850
The answer may be in the casket.

321
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,730
What... What do the numbers mean?

322
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,089
The numbers are in groups of three.

323
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:33,590
I think they're ciphers.

324
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,880
Ciphers?

325
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,159
Numbers or symbols are used to replace words.

326
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,120
If we want to understand the ciphers,

327
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,140
we must know in which way the numbers are translated into words.

328
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,700
Numbers are translated into words?

329
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,459
For example, one six three. There may be a book.

330
00:25:53,459 --> 00:25:56,299
One represents the first article in this book.

331
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:58,829
Six represents the sixth line of this article.

332
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:02,109
Three represents the third word in the sixth line.

333
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:06,090
So, one six three leads to a certain word.

334
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:12,350
You mean if we want to understand this, we must find the book first?

335
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,629
Sort of.

336
00:26:13,629 --> 00:26:16,419
But there isn't any book here.

337
00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:20,790
We searched Sir Witch Doctor's house but found no book, either.

338
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:25,920
Could it be an article he wrote or his favorite book?

339
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,489
His favorite book is Intrigues of the Warring States.

340
00:26:28,489 --> 00:26:30,779
I remember all his letters and articles.

341
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,480
It can't be any of them.

342
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,509
Wait.

343
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:41,719
It's not something related to him.

344
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:44,700
In the house he stayed in and on his corpse,

345
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,209
he left no clue about his real identity.

346
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,299
He knew that the one who solved the chess game and found his corpse

347
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,890
might not know his real identity.

348
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,609
The way to decode the ciphers has nothing to do with him.

349
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:03,160
But there's nothing more in the casket.

350
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,899
Wait a second.

351
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,640
There're words on the casket.

352
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,440
Yes. Let me have a look.

353
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,729
There're words on the cover, too.

354
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:22,160
Looks like a poem.

355
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,229
"Peach blossoms by the river.

356
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:28,109
A boy sits aside on the boat.

357
00:27:28,109 --> 00:27:30,050
The lady picks..."

358
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,330
Picks...

359
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,840
I can't read this word.

360
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,499
Cress.

361
00:27:38,499 --> 00:27:42,729
"The lady picks cress on the river.

362
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,500
Water ripples."

363
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,960
It's also a poem on the casket.

364
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,229
"Spring flowers wither and summer leaves grow.

365
00:27:54,229 --> 00:27:57,579
The moon shines over the bridge.

366
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,149
I can't help thinking of the past.

367
00:27:59,149 --> 00:28:02,380
Countless sorrow comes in clouds."

368
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,200
What... What's this?

369
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,619
"I'm so sad to leave.

370
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:13,650
Can't help missing you on rainy days."

371
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,840
What do the poems mean?

372
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,890
Are they the codebooks?

373
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,909
I have never heard of these two poems.

374
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,119
I think Prince Consort wrote them.

375
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,809
But they're mere doggerel.

376
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:27,899
Prince Consort shouldn't have written such poor poems.

377
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,299
Why do you think they're poor?

378
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,979
These words are difficult one after another.

379
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:35,289
Groups of three numbers for two poems.

380
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,169
How can we decode them?

381
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:40,330
Only about fifty words in two poems.

382
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:44,119
But there are more than a hundred numbers and ciphers.

383
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:48,959
Not to mention if the poems can be translated into another meaningful sentence,

384
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:51,460
even the numbers don't match.

385
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,699
Lord Jing, how does this word sound?

386
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,969
I didn't hear clearly.

387
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,030
Cress, sounds likes chess.

388
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,100
The same pronunciation?

389
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,710
The reverse phonetic notation!

390
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,369
The two poems weren't written for no reason.

391
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:24,679
In this first poem, there're 23 words.

392
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,860
All initial consonants are different.

393
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:36,949
Also, in the second poem, there're 36 words.

394
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,759
The compound vowels are different.

395
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,949
The numbers in groups of three represent a word from the first poem

396
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,879
and a tone from the second poem.

397
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,679
Then we can mark the pronunciation of each word

398
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,080
with the reverse phonetic notation.

399
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,389
I'm Censor Xiao Heng, working for Emperor Wenzong.

400
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:58,189
I'm leaving the cipher text, wishing a scholarly and brave man

401
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:01,109
to solve the puzzle of my haunted house, figure out the chess game,

402
00:30:01,109 --> 00:30:05,639
and find where I drown myself, so that the grievance will be redressed

403
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,179
and loyal men in Jiannan can be vindicated.

404
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:10,709
In the ninth year of his reign,

405
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,429
Emperor Wenzong wanted to wipe out eunuchs.

406
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,799
With a secret imperial decree, I asked Military Commissioner Chen Ying

407
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,059
to go to Chang'an for coordination.

408
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:19,799
Chen Ying was about to leave.

409
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,659
Unexpectedly, Incident Ganlu failed.

410
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:23,709
Eunuchs controlled His Majesty and killed officials.

411
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:26,109
Loyal generals including Chen Ying were slandered as rebels.

412
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,589
At the behest of His Majesty,

413
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:32,429
Military Commissioner Chen Ying rebelled with his troops!

414
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,850
They'll be executed right here!

415
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,979
Go!

416
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,980
Kill!

417
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,109
- Chen Ying!
- Censor Xiao, leave!

418
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,950
We rely on you to vindicate us!

419
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,680
Leave the eunuchs to us!

420
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,879
Leave!

421
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,170
Xiao Heng ran away! After him!

422
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,939
I broke through, with the secret decree.

423
00:32:13,939 --> 00:32:16,660
But I was encircled and badly wounded.

424
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,900
I had no choice, but to jump off the cliff.

425
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,969
Luckily, a witch doctor saved me.

426
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,309
I was in a coma for over a month.

427
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,779
When I woke up, I couldn't retrieve the situation.

428
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:39,939
Eunuchs faked an imperial edict and tried to lure me out

429
00:32:39,939 --> 00:32:41,299
with a heroic title and the rank of nobility

430
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:44,089
so that they could kill me to destroy the evidence.

431
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,819
If I took one wrong step, I wouldn't have been able to vindicate the loyal generals,

432
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:50,579
and would also have implicated more innocent people.

433
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,639
In desperation, after the witch doctor died of disease,

434
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,309
I took over his job

435
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:59,780
and dwelled in Pingle Town, Guanling, for the future plan.

436
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,909
Luckily, the Chu family took care of me.

437
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,849
I never forgot my mission.

438
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:28,059
However, Guanling County has a difficult terrain.

439
00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:31,249
One can't leave unless he uses a sliding rope.

440
00:33:31,249 --> 00:33:35,159
Eunuchs never stopped searching for me in the Southwest.

441
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,939
My legs were broken and I could hardly walk.

442
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,610
Local officials kept killing subordinates

443
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:43,819
of Military Commissioner of Jiannan who escaped to this town.

444
00:33:43,819 --> 00:33:47,059
I've never had a chance to contact people in Chang'an.

445
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:50,750
Later, a eunuch tracked me down alone.

446
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,939
I was lucky enough to kill him.

447
00:34:32,939 --> 00:34:37,810
I hid his corpse and sword in the wall, as evidence.

448
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:46,539
Unfortunately, my health condition got worse and I was dying soon.

449
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:51,270
I didn't want to die, but this was all I could do.

450
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:57,119
♫ Where it starts and ends, play the role of myself ♫

451
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,949
I'm writing this letter and will drown myself in the swamp,

452

burying myself in nature and hoping that someone will vindicate me.
